@article{Hamlington2007,
abstract = {Based on the physics underlying turbulence anisotropy in the equilibrium and nonequi- librium limits, a new physically-based, fully-realizable, nonequilibrium k −  RANS model has been developed. The model is based on an effective strain rate tensor that accounts for the strain history to which the turbulence has been subjected. This new model is applied to four distinctly different test cases for which the nonequilibrium history integral can be evaluated analytically. Results obtained from this new closure model show dramatically improved agreement with experimental and computational data when compared with the standard k− (SKE) model, without the need to vary any model parameters. The introduc- tion of a nonequilibrium effective strain rate allows this new model to be applied within a similar framework as currently used for two-equation eddy viscosity models, thereby permitting relatively simple implementation in existing CFD codes.},

abstract = {Turbulence modeling in a Reynolds Averaged Navier{\{}Stokes (RANS) setting has tra- ditionally evolved through a combination of theory, mathematics, and empiricism. The problem of closure, resulting from the averaging process, requires an infusion of informa- tion into the various models that is often managed in an ad-hoc way or that is focused on particular classes of problems, thus diminishing the predictive capabilities of a model in other flow contexts. In this work, a proof-of-concept of a new data-driven approach of turbulence model development is presented. The key idea in the proposed framework is to use supervised learning algorithms to build a representation of turbulence modeling closure terms. The learned terms are then inserted into a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) numerical simulation with the aim of offering a better representation of turbulence physics. But while the basic idea is attractive, modeling unknown terms by increasingly large amounts of data from higher-fidelity simulations (LES, DNS, etc) or even experiment, the details of how to make the approach viable are not at all obvious. In this work, we investigate the feasibility of such an approach by attempting to reproduce, through a machine learning methodology, the results obtained with the well-established Spalart- Allmaras model. In other words, the key question that we seek to answer is the following: Given a number of observations of CFD solutions using the Spalart-Allmaras model (our truth model), can we reproduce those solutions using machine-learning techniques with- out knowledge of the structure, functional form, and coefficients of the actual model? We discuss the challenges of applying machine learning techniques in a fluid dynamic setting and possible successful approaches. We also explore the potential for machine learning as an enhancement to or replacement for traditional turbulence models. Our results high- light the potential and viability of machine learning approaches to aid turbulence model development.}},

The performance of distance protection is evaluated for shunt-FACTS controllers applied for mid-point voltage control. The impact of two types of shunt FACTS controllers, static VAr compensators (SVC) and static synchronous compensators (STATCOM) on the transmission line distance protection are studied for different fault types, fault locations and system conditions. The dynamics of the shunt-FACTS controllers with their associated control systems are considered and simulated using RSCAD/RTDS testing environment. The performance of both the basic/non-pilot distance scheme and a directional comparison blocking (DCB) scheme are evaluated in this paper. The results of the commercial relay testing show the adverse effects of mid-point shunt-FACTS compensation of transmission line on both non-pilot and DCB distance protection schemes},

@article{Longo2017,
abstract = {When dealing with Atmospheric Boundary Layer (ABL) simulations, commercial computational fluid dynamics (CFD) acquires a strategic resonance. Thanks to its good compromise between accuracy of results and calculation time, RANS still represents a valid alternative to more resource-demanding methods. However, focusing on the models' performances in urban studies, LES generally outmatches RANS results, even if the former is at least one order of magnitude more expensive. Consequently, the present work aims to propose a variety of approaches meant to solve some of the major problems linked to RANS simulations and to further improve its accuracy in typical urban contexts. All of these models are capable of switching from an undisturbed flux formulation to a disturbed one through a local deviation or a marker function. For undisturbed flows, a comprehensive approach is adopted, solving the issue of the erroneous stream-wise gradients affecting the turbulent profiles. Around obstacles, Non-Linear Eddy-Viscosity closures are adopted, due to their prominent capability in capturing the anisotropy of turbulence. The purpose of this work is then to propose a new Building Influence Area concept and to offer more affordable alternatives to LES simulations without sacrificing a good grade of accuracy.},

@article{Calvetti2015,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2014 American Mathematical Society.In this article we discuss ill-posed inverse problems, with an emphasis on hierarchical variable order regularization. Traditionally, smoothness penalties in Tikhonov regularization assume a fixed degree of regularity of the unknown over the whole domain. Using a Bayesian framework with hierarchical priors, we derive a prior model, formally represented as a convex combination of autoregressive (AR) models, in which the parameter controlling the mixture of the AR models can dynamically change over the domain of the signal. Moreover, the mixture parameter itself is an unknown and is to be estimated using the data. Also, the variance of the innovation processes in the AR model is a free parameter, which leads to conditionally Gaussian priors that have been previously shown to be much more flexible than the traditional Gaussian priors, capable, e.g., to deal with sparsity type prior information. The suggested method, the Weighted Variable Order Autoregressive model (WVO-AR) is tested with a computed example.},

abstract = {In this paper we are concerned with obtaining estimates for the error in Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) simulations based on the Launder-Sharma k $\epsilon$ turbulence closure model, for a limited class of flows. In particular we search for estimates grounded in uncertainties in the space of model closure coefficients, for wall-bounded flows at a variety of favorable and adverse pressure gradients. In order to estimate the spread of closure coefficients which reproduces these flows accurately, we perform 13 separate Bayesian calibrations - each at a different pressure gradient - using measured boundary-layer velocity profiles, and a statistical model containing a multiplicative model-inadequacy term in the solution space. The results are 13 joint posterior distributions over coefficients and hyper-parameters. To summarize this information we compute Highest Posterior-Density (HPD) intervals, and subsequently represent the total solution uncertainty with a probability-box (p-box). This p-box represents both parameter variability across flows, and epistemic uncertainty within each calibration. A prediction of a new boundary-layer flow is made with uncertainty bars generated from this uncertainty information, and the resulting error estimate is shown to be consistent with measurement data. {\textcopyright} 2013.},

abstract = {Turbulence modeling is a critical component in numerical simulations of industrial flows based on Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations. However, after decades of efforts in the turbulence modeling community, universally applicable RANS models with predictive capabilities are still lacking. Recently, data-driven methods have been proposed as a promising alternative to the traditional approaches of turbulence model development. In this work we propose a data-driven, physics-informed machine learning approach for predicting discrepancies in RANS modeled Reynolds stresses. The discrepancies are formulated as functions of the mean flow features. By using a modern machine learning technique based on random forests, the discrepancy functions are first trained with benchmark flow data and then used to predict Reynolds stresses discrepancies in new flows. The method is used to predict the Reynolds stresses in the flow over periodic hills by using two training flow scenarios of increasing difficulties: (1) the flow in the same periodic hills geometry yet at a lower Reynolds number, and (2) the flow in a different hill geometry with a similar recirculation zone. Excellent predictive performances were observed in both scenarios, demonstrating the merits of the proposed method. Improvement of RANS modeled Reynolds stresses enabled by the proposed method is an important step towards predictive turbulence modeling, where the ultimate goal is to predict the quantities of interest (e.g., velocity field, drag, lift) more accurately by solving RANS equations with the Reynolds stresses obtained therefrom.},

abstract = {This paper presents results of the implementation of Spalart's quadratic constitutive relation into the Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations on two applications encountered in applied aerodynamics. These applications, one in external flow and one in internal flow, are intended to be representative of the problem of corner flow simulation, with the corner separation size being generally overestimated by classical turbulence models. The first application is the DLR-F6 wing/body configuration used in the Drag Prediction Workshop, where a separation occurs at the wing/ body junction in the case without fairing. The second application is the shock-induced separation in a rectangular duct. It is shown that the quadratic constitutive relation greatly improves the accuracy of the junction flow simulation without worsening the quality of the solution elsewhere.

abstract = {The data-driven discovery of dynamics via machine learning is currently pushing the frontiers of modeling and control efforts, and it provides a tremendous opportunity to extend the reach of model predictive control. However, many leading methods in machine learning, such as neural networks, require large volumes of training data, may not be interpretable, do not easily include known constraints and symmetries, and often do not generalize beyond the attractor where models are trained. These factors limit the use of these techniques for the online identification of a model in the low-data limit, for example following an abrupt change to the system dynamics. In this work, we extend the recent sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDY) modeling procedure to include the effects of actuation and demonstrate the ability of these models to enhance the performance of model predictive control (MPC), based on limited, noisy data. SINDY models are parsimonious, identifying the fewest terms in the model needed to explain the data, making them interpretable, generalizable, and reducing the burden of training data. We show that the resulting SINDY-MPC framework has higher performance, requires significantly less data, and is more computationally efficient and robust to noise than neural network models, making it viable for online training and execution in response to rapid changes to the system. SINDY-MPC also shows improved performance over linear data-driven models, although linear models may provide a stopgap until enough data is available for SINDY.},

abstract = {Although major advances have been achieved over the past decades for the reduction and identification of linear systems, deriving nonlinear low-order models still is a chal- lenging task. In this work, we develop a new data-driven framework to identify nonlinear reduced-order models of a fluid by combining dimensionality reductions techniques (e.g. proper orthogonal decomposition) and sparse regression techniques from machine learn- ing. In particular, we extend the sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) algorithm to enforce physical constraints in the regression, namely energy-preserving quadratic nonlinearities. The resulting models, hereafter referred to as Galerkin regression models, incorporate many beneficial aspects of Galerkin projection, but without the need for a full-order or high-fidelity solver to project the Navier-Stokes equations. Instead, the most parsimonious nonlinear model is determined that is consistent with observed mea- surement data and satisfies necessary constraints. Galerkin regression models also readily generalize to include higher-order nonlinear terms that model the effect of truncated modes. The effectiveness of Galerkin regression is demonstrated on two different flow configurations: the two-dimensional flow past a circular cylinder and the shear-driven cavity flow. For both cases, the accuracy of the identified models compare favorably against reduced-order models obtained from a standard Galerkin projection procedure. Present results highlight the importance of cubic nonlinearities in the construction of accurate nonlinear low-dimensional approximations of the flow systems, something which cannot be readily obtained using a standard Galerkin projection of the Navier-Stokes equations. Finally, the entire code base for our constrained sparse Galerkin regression algorithm is freely available online.},

abstract = {Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations are widely used in engineering turbulent flow simulations. However, RANS predictions may have large discrepancies due to the uncertainties in modeled Reynolds stresses. Recently, Wang et al. demonstrated that machine learning can be used to improve the RANS modeled Reynolds stresses by lever-aging data from high fidelity simulations (Physics informed machine learning approach for reconstructing Reynolds stress modeling discrepancies based on DNS data. Physical Review Fluids. 2, 034603, 2017). However, solving for mean flows from the improved Reynolds stresses still poses significant challenges due to potential ill-conditioning of RANS equations with Reynolds stress closures. Enabling improved predictions of mean velocities are of profound practical importance, because often the velocity and its derived quantities (QoIs, e.g., drag, lift, surface friction), and not the Reynolds stress itself, are of ultimate interest in RANS simulations. To this end, we present a comprehensive framework for augmenting turbulence models with physics-informed machine learning, illustrating a complete workflow from identification of input features to final prediction of mean velocities. This work has two innovations. First, we demonstrate a systematic procedure to generate mean flow features based on the integrity basis for mean flow tensors. Second, we propose using machine learning to predict linear and nonlinear parts of the Reynolds stress tensor separately. Inspired by the finite polynomial representation of tensors in classical turbulence modeling, such a decomposition is instrumental in overcoming the ill-conditioning of RANS equations. Numerical tests demonstrated merits of the proposed framework.},

This paper reviews the considerable progress of recent years in improving model proficiency for aerodynamic applications. The limitations to what can be achieved are discussed and it is suggested that some important flow regimes are beyond the RANS approach.

An algorithm of this kind has been proposed for the L1-penalized regression (lasso) in the literature, but it seems to have been largely ignored. Indeed, it seems that coordinate-wise algorithms are not often used in convex optimization. We show that this algorithm is very competitive with the well-known LARS (or homotopy) procedure in large lasso problems, and that it can be applied to related methods such as the garotte and elastic net. It turns out that coordinate-wise descent does not work in the “fused lasso,” however, so we derive a generalized algorithm that yields the solution in much less time that a standard convex optimizer. Finally, we generalize the procedure to the two-dimensional fused lasso, and demonstrate its performance on some image smoothing problems.},

abstract = {We have performed direct numerical Simulations of turbulent flows in a square duct considering a range of Reynolds numbers spanning from a marginal state up to fully developed turbulent states at low Reynolds numbers. The main motivation stems from the relatively poor knowledge about the basic physical mechanisms that are responsible for one of the most outstanding features of this class of turbulent flows: Prandtl's secondary motion of the second kind. In particular, the focus is upon the role of flow structures in its generation and characterization when increasing the Reynolds number. We present a two-fold scenario. On the one hand, buffer layer structures determine the distribution of mean streamwise vorticity. On the other hand, the shape and the quantitative character of the mean secondary flow, defined through the mean cross-stream function, are influenced by motions taking place at larger scales. It is shown that high velocity streaks are preferentially located in the corner region (e.g. less than 50 wall units apart from a sidewall), flanked by low velocity ones. These locations are determined by the positioning of quasi-streamwise vortices with a preferential sign of rotation in agreement with the above described velocity streaks' positions. This preferential arrangement of the classical buffer layer structures determines the pattern of the mean streamwise vorticity that approaches the corners with increasing Reynolds number. On the other hand, the centre of the mean secondary flow, defined as the position of the extrema of the mean cross-stream function (Computed using the mean streamwise vorticity), remains at a constant location departing from the mean streamwise vorticity field for larger Reynolds numbers, i.e. it scales in outer units. This paper also presents a detailed validation of the numerical technique including a comparison of the numerical results with data obtained from a companion experiment.},

abstract = {Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) simulations with turbulence models continue to play important roles in industrial flow simulations as high-fidelity simulations are prohibitively expensive for such flows. Commonly used linear eddy viscosity models are intrinsically unable to handle flows with non-equilibrium turbulence (e.g., flows with massive separation). Reynolds stress models, on the other hand, are plagued by their lack of robustness and stability. Recent studies found that even substituting Reynolds stresses from DNS databases (with errors below 0.5{\%}) into RANS equations leads to grossly inaccurate velocities. Such an observation is not only disturbing for the recently emerging data-driven Reynolds stress models but also relevant for traditional, equation-based models. This observation cannot be explained by the global matrix condition number of the discretized RANS equations. In this work, we propose a metric based on local condition numbers for a priori evaluation of the stability of Reynolds stress models. Numerical tests on turbulent channel flows at various Reynolds numbers suggest that the proposed metric can adequately explain observations in previous studies, i.e., decreased model stability with increasing Reynolds number, and better stability of the implicit treatment of Reynolds stress compared to the explicit treatment.},

abstract = {The ability to discover physical laws and governing equations from data is one of humankind's greatest intellectual achievements. A quantitative understanding of dynamic constraints and balances in nature has facilitated rapid development of knowledge and enabled advanced technological achievements, including aircraft, combustion engines, satellites, and electrical power. In this work, we combine sparsity-promoting techniques and machine learning with nonlinear dynamical systems to discover governing physical equations from measurement data. The only assumption about the structure of the model is that there are only a few important terms that govern the dynamics, so that the equations are sparse in the space of possible functions; this assumption holds for many physical systems. In particular, we use sparse regression to determine the fewest terms in the dynamic governing equations required to accurately represent the data. The resulting models are parsimonious, balancing model complexity with descriptive ability while avoiding overfitting. We demonstrate the algorithm on a wide range of problems, from simple canonical systems, including linear and nonlinear oscillators and the chaotic Lorenz system, to the fluid vortex shedding behind an obstacle. The fluid example illustrates the ability of this method to discover the underlying dynamics of a system that took experts in the community nearly 30 years to resolve. We also show that this method generalizes to parameterized, time-varying, or externally forced systems.},

abstract = {This article describes a robust algorithm to estimate a conditional probability density f(t|x) as a non-parametric smooth regression function. It is based on a neural network and the Bayesian interpretation of the network output as a posteriori probabability. The network is trained using example events from history or simulation, which define the underlying probability density f(t,x). Once trained, the network is applied on new, unknown examples x, for which it can predict the probability distribution of the target variable t. Event-by-event knowledge of the smooth function f(t|x) can be very useful, e.g. in maximum likelihood fits or for forecasting tasks. No assumptions are necessary about the distribution, and non-Gaussian tails are accounted for automatically. Important quantities like median, mean value, left and right standard deviations, moments and expectation values of any function of t are readily derived from it. The algorithm can be considered as an event-by-event unfolding and leads to statistically optimal reconstruction. The largest benefit of the method lies in complicated problems, when the measurements x are only relatively weakly correlated to the output t. As to assure optimal generalisation features and to avoid overfitting, the networks are regularised by extended versions of weight decay. The regularisation parameters are determined during the online-learning of the network by relations obtained from Bayesian statistics. Some toy Monte Carlo tests and first real application examples from high-energy physics and econometry are discussed.},

@article{Murari2015b,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 IAEA, Vienna. In many scientific applications, it is important to investigate how certain properties scale with the parameters of the systems. The experimental studies of scalings have traditionally been addressed with log regression, which limits the results to power laws and to theoretical and not data-driven dimensionless quantities. This has also been the case in nuclear fusion, in which the scaling of the energy confinement time is a crucial aspect in understanding the physics of transport and in the design of future devices. Traditionally two main assumptions are at the basis of the most widely accepted empirical scaling laws for the confinement time: (a) the dimensionless variables used are the ones derived from the symmetries of the Vlasov equation; (b) the final scalings have the mathematical form of power laws. In this paper, it is shown how symbolic regression (SR), implemented with genetic programming (GP) techniques, can be used to test these hypotheses. Neither assumption is confirmed by the available data of the multi-machine International Tokamak Physics Activity (ITPA) of validated tokamak discharges. The statistically soundest expressions are not power laws and cannot be formulated in terms of the traditional dimensionless quantities. The consequences of the data-driven scaling laws obtained are both practical and theoretical: the confinement time for the ITER can be significantly shorter than foreseen by power laws and different dimensionless variables should be considered for theoretical investigations. On the other hand, higher quality databases should be built to reduce the uncertainties in the extrapolations. It is also worth emphasising that the proposed methodology is fully general and therefore can be applied to any field of science.},

Often, these rely on various concepts from statistical and nonlinear physics such as phase transitions, bifurcation, stabilities, and robustness. The methodologies have the potential to significantly improve our ability to understand a variety of complex dynamical systems ranging from gene regulatory systems to social networks towards the ultimate goal of controlling such systems. Despite recent progress, many challenges remain. A purpose of this Review is then to point out the specific difficulties as they arise from different contexts, so as to stimulate further efforts in this interdisciplinary field.},

abstract = {This paper presents a new strategy for turbulence model employment with emphasis on the model's applicability for industrial computational fluid dynamics (CFD). In the hybrid modelling strategy proposed here, the Reynolds stress and mean rate of strain tensors are coupled via Boussinesq's formula as in the standard k-model. However, the turbulent kinetic energy is calculated as the sum of the normal Reynolds-stress components, representing the solutions of the appropriate transport equations. The equations governing the Reynolds-stress tensor and dissipation rate have been solved in the framework of a background second-moment closure model. Furthermore, the structure parameter C-? has been re-calculated from a newly proposed functional dependency rather than kept constant. This new definition of C-? has been assessed by using direct numerical simulation (DNS) results of several generic flow configurations featuring different phenomena such as separation, reattachment and rotation. Comparisons show a large departure of C-? from the commonly used value of 0.09. The model proposed is computationally validated in a number of well-proven fluid flow benchmarks, e.g. backward-facing step, 180 turn-around duct, rotating pipe, impinging jet and three-dimensional (3D) Ahmed body. The obtained results confirm that the present hybrid model delivers a robust solution procedure while preserving most of the physical advantages of the Reynolds-stress model over simple k-models. A low Reynolds number version of the hybrid model is also proposed and discussed.},

While the marginal posterior mode of the regression coefficients is equivalent to estimates given by the non-Bayesian elastic net, the Bayesian elastic net has two major advantages. Firstly, as a Bayesian method, the distributional results on the estimates are straightforward, making the statistical inference easier. Secondly, it chooses the two penalty parameters simultaneously, avoiding the " double shrinkage problem " in the elastic net method. Real data examples and simulation studies show that the Bayesian elastic net behaves comparably in prediction accuracy but performs better in variable selection.},

Genetic programming (GP) is one of the most popular methods for symbolic regression. However, its convergence speed might be too slow for large scale problems with a large number of variables. This drawback has become a bottleneck in practical applications. In this paper, a new non-evolutionary real-time algorithm for symbolic regression, Elite Bases Regression (EBR), is proposed. EBR generates a set of candidate basis functions coded with parse-matrix in specific mapping rules. Meanwhile, a certain number of elite bases are preserved and updated iteratively according to the correlation coefficients with respect to the target model. The regression model is then spanned by the elite bases. A comparative study between EBR and a recent proposed machine learning method for symbolic regression, Fast Function eXtraction (FFX), are conducted. Numerical results indicate that EBR can solve symbolic regression problems more effectively.},

abstract = {Hybrid systems are traditionally difficult to identify and analyze using classical dynamical systems theory. Moreover, recently developed model identification methodologies largely focus on identifying a single set of governing equations solely from measurement data. In this article, we develop a new methodology, Hybrid-Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (Hybrid-SINDy), which identifies separate nonlinear dynamical regimes, employs information theory to manage uncertainty, and characterizes switching behavior. Specifically, we utilize the nonlinear geometry of data collected from a complex system to construct a set of coordinates based on measurement data and augmented variables. Clustering the data in these measurement-based coordinates enables the identification of nonlinear hybrid systems. This methodology broadly empowers nonlinear system identification without constraining the data locally in time and has direct connections to hybrid systems theory. We demonstrate the success of this method on numerical examples including a mass-spring hopping model and an infectious disease model. Characterizing complex systems that switch between dynamic behaviors is integral to overcoming modern challenges such as eradication of infectious diseases, the design of efficient legged robots, and the protection of cyber infrastructures.},

abstract = {Despite their well-known limitations, Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) models are still the workhorse tools for turbulent flow simulations in today's engineering application. For many practical flows, the turbulence models are by far the largest source of uncertainty. In this work we develop an open-box, physics-informed Bayesian framework for quantifying model-form uncertainties in RANS simulations. Uncertainties are introduced directly to the Reynolds stresses and are represented with compact parameterization accounting for empirical prior knowledge and physical constraints (e.g., realizability, smoothness, and symmetry). An iterative ensemble Kalman method is used to assimilate the prior knowledge and observation data in a Bayesian framework, and to propagate them to posterior distributions of velocities and other Quantities of Interest (QoIs). We use two representative cases, the flow over periodic hills and the flow in a square duct, to evaluate the performance of the proposed framework. Simulation results suggest that, even with very sparse observations, the posterior mean velocities and other QoIs have significantly better agreement with the benchmark data compared to the baseline results. At most locations the posterior distribution adequately captures the true model error within the developed model form uncertainty bounds. The framework is a major improvement over existing black-box, physics-neutral methods for model-form uncertainty quantification, and has potential implications in many fields in which the model uncertainty comes from unresolved physical processes. A notable example is climate modeling, where high-consequence decisions are made based on predictions (e.g., projected temperature rise) with major uncertainties originating from closure models that are used to account for unresolved or unknown physics including radiation, cloud, and boundary layer processes.},

abstract = {Modelling of complex turbulent flows using explicit algebraic Reynolds stress and scalar flux models (EARSM and EASFM) has been considered. The eddy- viscosity or eddy-diffusivity assumption has been replaced by amore general con- stitutive relation for the second-order correlation in the Reynolds averaged equa- tions. This relation has been derived using a formal approximation of the corre- sponding second-order transport model equations in the weak-equilibrium limit. The proposed EARSM is an exact solution of the implicit algebraic Reynolds stress model (ARSM) for two-dimensional mean flows and a reasonable approx- imation also in three-dimensional mean flows where the fully three-dimensional tensorial form is kept. Asymptotically correct near-wall treatment,extension to compressible mean flows and approximations of the neglected advection and diffusion terms are proposed. The resulting model behaves well in a number of different engineering and generic test cases giving significant improvements compared to standard eddy-viscosity models and the computational effort was comparable to standard two-equation models. The proposed EASFM is an exact solution of the corresponding implicit algebraic model in both two- and three- dimensional mean flows. Apriori tests show good model behaviour in homoge- neous shear flows,channel and wake flow for the scalar flux vector.},

abstract = {Non-intrusive polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) and stochastic collocation (SC) methods are attractive techniques for uncertainty quantification (UQ) due to their strong mathematical basis and ability to produce functional representations of stochastic variability. PCE estimates coefficients for known orthogonal polynomial basis functions based on a set of response function evaluations, using sampling, linear regression, tensor-product quadra- ture, or Smolyak sparse grid approaches. SC, on the other hand, forms interpolation functions for known coefficients, and requires the use of structured collocation point sets derived from tensor product or sparse grids. When tailoring the basis functions or interpo- lation grids to match the forms of the input uncertainties, exponential convergence rates can be achieved with both techniques for a range of probabilistic analysis problems. In addition, analytic features of the expansions can be exploited for moment estimation and stochastic sensitivity analysis. In this paper, the latest ideas for tailoring these expansion methods to numerical integration approaches will be explored, in which expansion formula- tions are modified to best synchronize with tensor-product quadrature and Smolyak sparse grids using linear and nonlinear growth rules. The most promising stochastic expansion ap- proaches are then carried forward for use in new approaches for mixed aleatory-epistemic UQ, employing second-order probability approaches, and design under uncertainty, employing bilevel, sequential, and multifidelity approaches.Hierarchische},

abstract = {Extreme learning machine (ELM) has gained increasing interest from various research fields recently. In this review, we aim to report the current state of the theoretical research and practical advances on this subject. We first give an overview of ELM from the theoretical perspective, including the interpolation theory, universal approximation capability, and generalization ability. Then we focus on the various improvements made to ELM which further improve its stability, sparsity and accuracy under general or specific conditions. Apart from classification and regression, ELM has recently been extended for clustering, feature selection, representational learning and many other learning tasks. These newly emerging algorithms greatly expand the applications of ELM. From implementation aspect, hardware implementation and parallel computation techniques have substantially sped up the training of ELM, making it feasible for big data processing and real-time reasoning. Due to its remarkable efficiency, simplicity, and impressive generalization performance, ELM have been applied in a variety of domains, such as biomedical engineering, computer vision, system identification, and control and robotics. In this review, we try to provide a comprehensive view of these advances in ELM together with its future perspectives.},

abstract = {Solving inverse problems based on computationally demanding forward models is ubiquitously difficult since one is necessarily limited to just a few observations of the response surface. The usual practice is to replace the response surface with a surrogate. However, this approach induces additional uncertainties on the posterior distributions. The main contribution of this work is the reformulation of the Bayesian solution of the inverse problem when the expensive forward model is replaced by the surrogate. We derive three approximations of the reformulated solution with increasing complexity and fidelity. We demonstrate numerically that the proposed approximations capture the uncertainty of the solution of the inverse problem induced by the fact that the forward model is replaced by a finite number of simulations. We demonstrate our approach in two different problems: locating the contamination source of a diffusive process and inferring the permeability field of an oil reservoir based on measurements of the oil-cut curves.},

abstract = {Data assimilation is the process by which observational data are fused with scientific information. The Bayesian paradigm provides a coherent probabilistic approach for combining information, and thus is an appropriate framework for data assimilation. Viewing data assimilation as a problem in Bayesian statistics is not new. However, the field of Bayesian statistics is rapidly evolving and new approaches for model construction and sampling have been utilized recently in a wide variety of disciplines to combine information. This article includes a brief introduction to Bayesian methods. Paying particular attention to data assimilation, we review linkages to optimal interpolation, kriging, Kalman filtering, smoothing, and variational analysis. Discussion is provided concerning Monte Carlo methods for implementing Bayesian analysis, including importance sampling, particle filtering, ensemble Kalman filtering, and Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling. Finally, hierarchical Bayesian modeling is reviewed. We indicate how this approach can be used to incorporate significant physically based prior information into statistical models, thereby accounting for uncertainty. The approach is illustrated in a simplified advection-diffusion model. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

@article{Murari2017a,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 EURATOM. Understanding the many aspects of tokamak physics requires the development of quite sophisticated models. Moreover, in the operation of the devices, prediction of the future evolution of discharges can be of crucial importance, particularly in the case of the prediction of disruptions, which can cause serious damage to various parts of the machine. The determination of the limits of predictability is therefore an important issue for modelling, classifying and forecasting. In all these cases, once a certain level of performance has been reached, the question typically arises as to whether all the information available in the data has been exploited, or whether there are still margins for improvement of the tools being developed. In this paper, a theoretical information approach is proposed to address this issue. The excellent properties of the developed indicator, called the prediction factor (PF), have been proved with the help of a series of numerical tests. Its application to some typical behaviour relating to macroscopic instabilities in tokamaks has shown very positive results. The prediction factor has also been used to assess the performance of disruption predictors running in real time in the JET system, including the one systematically deployed in the feedback loop for mitigation purposes. The main conclusion is that the most advanced predictors basically exploit all the information contained in the locked mode signal on which they are based. Therefore, qualitative improvements in disruption prediction performanc e in JET would need the processing of additional signals, probably profiles.},

@article{Hinton2015,
abstract = {A very simple way to improve the performance of almost any machine learning algorithm is to train many different models on the same data and then to average their predictions. Unfortunately, making predictions using a whole ensemble of models is cumbersome and may be too computationally expensive to allow deployment to a large number of users, especially if the individual models are large neural nets. Caruana and his collaborators have shown that it is possible to compress the knowledge in an ensemble into a single model which is much easier to deploy and we develop this approach further using a different compression technique. We achieve some surprising results on MNIST and we show that we can significantly improve the acoustic model of a heavily used commercial system by distilling the knowledge in an ensemble of models into a single model. We also introduce a new type of ensemble composed of one or more full models and many specialist models which learn to distinguish fine-grained classes that the full models confuse. Unlike a mixture of experts, these specialist models can be trained rapidly and in parallel.},

abstract = {Adherent cells exert traction forces on to their environment, which allows them to migrate, to maintain tissue integrity, and to form complex multicellular structures. This traction can be measured in a perturbation-free manner with traction force microscopy (TFM). In TFM, traction is usually calculated via the solution of a linear system, which is complicated by undersampled input data, acquisition noise, and large condition numbers for some methods. Therefore, standard TFM algorithms either employ data filtering or regularization. However, these approaches require a manual selection of filter- or regularization parameters and consequently exhibit a substantial degree of subjectiveness. This shortcoming is particularly serious when cells in different conditions are to be compared because optimal noise suppression needs to be adapted for every situation, which invariably results in systematic errors. Here, we systematically test the performance of new methods from computer vision and Bayesian inference for solving the inverse problem in TFM. We compare two classical schemes, L1- and L2-regularization, with three previously untested schemes, namely Elastic Net regularization, Proximal Gradient Lasso, and Proximal Gradient Elastic Net. Overall, we find that Elastic Net regularization, which combines L1 and L2 regularization, outperforms all other methods with regard to accuracy of traction reconstruction. Next, we develop two methods, Bayesian L2 regularization and Advanced Bayesian L2 regularization, for automatic, optimal L2 regularization. Using artificial data and experimental data, we show that these methods enable robust reconstruction of traction without requiring a difficult selection of regularization parameters specifically for each data set. Thus, Bayesian methods can mitigate the considerable uncertainty inherent in comparing cellular traction forces.},

abstract = {With the advance of modern technology, more and more data are being recorded continuously during a time interval or intermittently at several discrete time points. They are both examples of "functional data", which have become a prevailing type of data. Functional Data Analysis (FDA) encompasses the statistical methodology for such data. Broadly interpreted, FDA deals with the analysis and theory of data that are in the form of functions. This paper provides an overview of FDA, starting with simple statistical notions such as mean and covariance functions, then covering some core techniques, the most popular of which is Functional Principal Component Analysis (FPCA). FPCA is an important dimension reduction tool and in sparse data situations can be used to impute functional data that are sparsely observed. Other dimension reduction approaches are also discussed. In addition, we review another core technique, functional linear regression, as well as clustering and classification of functional data. Beyond linear and single or multiple index methods we touch upon a few nonlinear approaches that are promising for certain applications. They include additive and other nonlinear functional regression models, such as time warping, manifold learning, and dynamic modeling with empirical differential equations. The paper concludes with a brief discussion of future directions.},

abstract = {Classification models built on biological expression data are increasingly used to predict distinct disease subtypes. Selected features that separate sample groups can be the candidates of biomarkers, helping us to discover biological functions/pathways. However, three challenges are associated with building a robust classification and feature selection model: 1) the number of significant biomarkers is much smaller than that of measured features for which the search will be exhaustive; 2) current biological expression data are big in both sample size and feature size which will worsen the scalability of any search algorithms; and 3) expression profiles of certain features are typically highly correlated which may prevent to distinguish the predominant features. Unfortunately, most of the existing algorithms are partially addressing part of these challenges but not as a whole. In this paper, we propose a unified framework to address the above challenges. The classification and feature selection problem is first formulated as a nonconvex optimisation problem. Then the problem is relaxed and solved iteratively by a sequence of convex optimisation procedures which can be distributed computed and therefore allows the efficient implementation on advanced infrastructures. To illustrate the competence of our method over others, we first analyse a randomly generated simulation dataset under various conditions. We then analyse a real gene expression dataset on embryonal tumour. Further downstream analysis, such as functional annotation and pathway analysis, are performed on the selected features which elucidate several biological findings.},

abstract = {A researcher can infer mathematical expressions of functions quickly by using his professional knowledge (called Prior Knowledge). But the results he finds may be biased and restricted to his research field due to limitation of his knowledge. In contrast, Genetic Programming method can discover fitted mathematical expressions from the huge search space through running evolutionary algorithms. And its results can be generalized to accommodate different fields of knowledge. However, since GP has to search a huge space, its speed of finding the results is rather slow. Therefore, in this paper, a framework of connection between Prior Formula Knowledge and GP (PFK-GP) is proposed to reduce the space of GP searching. The PFK is built based on the Deep Belief Network (DBN) which can identify candidate formulas that are consistent with the features of experimental data. By using these candidate formulas as the seed of a randomly generated population, PFK-GP finds the right formulas quickly by exploring the search space of data features. We have compared PFK-GP with Pareto GP on regression of eight benchmark problems. The experimental results confirm that the PFK-GP can reduce the search space and obtain the significant improvement in the quality of SR.},

abstract = {Data assimilation can be used to combine experimental and numerical realizations of the same flow to produce hybrid flow fields. These have the advantages of less noise contamination and higher resolution while simultaneously reproducing the main physical features of the measured flow. This study investigates data assimilation of the mean flow around an idealized airfoil (Re = 13,500) obtained from time-averaged two-dimensional particle image velocimetry (PIV) data. The experimental data, which constitute a low-dimensional representation of the full flow field due to resolution and field-of-view limitations, are incorporated into a simulation governed by the two-dimensional, incompressible Reynolds-averaged Navier--Stokes (RANS) equations with an unknown momentum forcing. This forcing, which corresponds to the divergence of the Reynolds stress tensor, is calculated from a direct-adjoint optimization procedure to match the experimental and numerical mean velocity fields. The simulation is projected onto the low-dimensional subspace of the experiment to calculate the discrepancy and a smoothing procedure is used to recover adjoint solutions on the higher dimensional subspace of the simulation. The study quantifies how well data assimilation can reconstruct the mean flow and the minimum experimental measurements needed by altering the resolution and domain size of the time-averaged PIV.},

However, due to the nonstationarity of wind power series, traditional point forecasting can hardly be accurate, leading to increased uncertainties and risks for system operation. This paper proposes an extreme learning machine (ELM)-based probabilistic forecasting method for wind power generation. To account for the uncertainties in the forecasting results, several bootstrap methods have been compared for modeling the regression uncertainty, based on which the pairs bootstrap method is identified with the best performance. Consequently, a new method for prediction intervals formulation based on the ELM and the pairs bootstrap is developed. Wind power forecasting has been conducted in different seasons using the proposed approach with the historical wind power time series as the inputs alone. The results demonstrate that the proposed method is effective for probabilistic forecasting of wind power generation with a high potential for practical applications in power systems.},

For two-dimensional flows, the co-efficients of this polynomial are evaluated from the modelled Reynolds-stress equations of Launder, Reece {\&} Rodi (1975). The advantage of the proposed effective-viscosity formulation, equation (4.3), over isotropic-viscosity hypoth-eses is that the whole velocity-gradient tensor affects the predicted Reynolds stresses. Two notable consequences of this are that (i) the complete Reynolds-stress tensor is realistically modelled and (ii) the influence of streamline curvature on the Reynolds stresses is incorporated.},

Both the self noise from the interaction of a turbulent boundary layer with the trailing edge of an porous airfoil and the noise generated at the leading edge due to turbulent inflow are considered. Following a dimensional analysis, models are built for trailing edge noise and leading edge noise in terms of four and six dimensionless quantities, respectively. Models of different accuracy and complexity are proposed and discussed. For the trailing edge noise case, a general dependency of the sound power on the fifth power of the flow velocity was found and the frequency spectrum is controlled by the flow resistivity of the porous material. Leading edge noise power is proportional to the square of the turbulence intensity and shows a dependency on the fifth to sixth power of the flow velocity, while the spectrum is governed by the flow resistivity and the integral length scale of the incoming turbulence.},

abstract = {A modeling paradigm is developed to augment predictive models of turbulence by effectively utilizing limited data generated from physical experiments. The key components of our approach involve inverse modeling to infer the spatial distribution of model discrepancies, and, machine learning to reconstruct discrepancy information from a large number of inverse problems into corrective model forms. We apply the methodology to turbulent flows over airfoils involving flow separation. Model augmentations are developed for the Spalart Allmaras (SA) model using adjoint-based full field inference on experimentally measured lift coefficient data. When these model forms are reconstructed using neural networks (NN) and embedded within a standard solver, we show that much improved predictions can be obtained, including for geometries and flow conditions that were not used to train the model. The NN-augmented SA model is also confirmed to predict surface pressures extremely well. The broader vision is that by incorporating data that can reveal the form of the innate model discrepancy, the applicability of data-driven turbulence models can be extended to more general flows.},

abstract = {Feature identification is an important task in many fluid dynamics applications and diverse methods have been developed for this purpose. These methods are based on a physical understanding of the underlying behavior of the flow in the vicinity of the feature. Particularly, they rely on definition of suitable criteria (i.e. point-based or neighborhood-based derived properties) and proper selection of thresholds. For instance, among other techniques, vortex identification can be done through computing the Q-criterion or by considering the center of looping streamlines. However, these methods rely on creative visualization of physical idiosyncrasies of specific features and flow regimes, making them non-universal and requiring significant effort to develop. Here we present a physics-based, data-driven method capable of identifying any flow feature it is trained to. We use convolutional neural networks, a machine learning approach developed for image recognition, and adapt it to the problem of identifying flow features. The method was tested using mean flow fields from numerical simulations, where the recirculation region and boundary layer were identified in a two-dimensional flow through a convergent-divergent channel, and the horseshoe vortex was identified in three-dimensional flow over a wing-body junction. The novelty of the method is its ability to identify any type of feature, even distinguish between similar ones, without the need to explicitly define the physics (i.e. through development of suitable criterion and tunning of threshold). This provides a general method and removes the large burden placed on identifying new features. We expect this method can supplement existing techniques and allow for more automatic and discerning feature detection. The method can be easily extended to time-dependent flows, where it could be particularly impactful.},

This paper presents an approach that develops turbulence models for flows exhibiting organised unsteadiness. The novel framework consists of three parts. First, using triple decomposition, the high-fidelity data is split into organised motion and stochastic turbulence. A data-driven approach is then used to develop a closure only for the stochastic part of turbulence. Finally, unsteady calculations are conducted, which resolve the organised structures and model the unresolved turbulence using the developed bespoke turbulence closure. A case study of a wake with vortex shedding behind a normal flat plate, at a Reynolds number of 2,000, based on plate height and freestream velocity, is considered to demonstrate the method. The approach shows significant improvement in mean velocity and Reynold stress profiles compared with standard turbulence models.},

We assume that the governing partial differential equation (PDE) is a linear combination of a subset of a prescribed dictionary containing different differential terms, and the objective of this paper is to find the correct coefficients. We propose a new direction based on the fundamental idea of convergence analysis of numerical PDE schemes. We utilize Lasso for efficiency, and a performance guarantee is established based on an incoherence property. The main contribution is to validate and correct the results by Time Evolution Error (TEE). The new algorithm, called Identifying Differential Equations with Numerical Time evolution (IDENT), is explored for data with non-periodic boundary conditions , noisy data and PDEs with varying coefficients. From the recovery analysis of Lasso, we propose a new definition of Noise-to-Signal ratio, which better represents the level of noise in the case of PDE identification. We systematically analyze the effects of data generations and downsampling, and propose an order preserving denoising method called Least-Squares Moving Average (LSMA), to preprocess the given data. For the identification of PDEs with varying coefficients, we propose to add Base Element Expansion (BEE) to aide the computation. Various numerical experiments from basic tests to noisy data, downsampling effects and varying coefficients are presented.},

abstract = {Simulation and empirical studies of genomic selection (GS) show accuracies sufficient to generate rapid genetic gains. However, with the increased popularity of GS approaches, numerous models have been proposed and no comparative analysis is available to identify the most promising ones. Using eight wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh., and maize (Zea mays L.) datasets, the predictive ability of currently available GS models along with several machine learning methods was evaluated by comparing accuracies, the genomic estimated breeding values (GEBVs), and the marker effects for each model. While a similar level of accuracy was observed for many models, the level of overfitting varied widely as did the computation time and the distribution of marker effect estimates. Our comparisons suggested that GS in plant breeding programs could be based on a reduced set of models such as the Bayesian Lasso, weighted Bayesian shrinkage regression (wBSR, a fast version of BayesB), and random forest (RF) (a machine learning method that could capture nonadditive effects). Linear combinations of different models were tested as well as bagging and boosting methods, but they did not improve accuracy. This study also showed large differences in accuracy between subpopulations within a dataset that could not always be explained by differences in phenotypic variance and size. The broad diversity of empirical datasets tested here adds evidence that GS could increase genetic gain per unit of time and cost.},

abstract = {Two-dimensional flow over periodically arranged hills was investigated experimentally in a water channel. Two-dimensional particle image velocimetry (PIV) and one-dimensional laser Doppler anemometry (LDA) measurements were undertaken at four Reynolds numbers (5,600 ≤ Re ≤ 37,000). Two-dimensional PIV field measurements were thoroughly validated by means of point-by-point 1D LDA measurements at certain positions of the flow. A detailed study of the periodicity and the homogeneity was undertaken, which demonstrates that the flow can be regarded as two-dimensional and periodic for Re ≥ 10,000. We found a decreasing reattachment length with increasing Reynolds number. This is connected to a higher momentum in the near-wall zone close to flow separation which comes from the velocity speed up above the obstacle. This leads to a velocity overshoot directly above the hill crest which increases with Reynolds number as the inner layer depth decreases. The flow speed up above that layer is independent of the Reynolds number which supports the assumption of inviscid flow disturbance in the outer layer usually made in asymptotic theory for flow over small hills. {\textcopyright} 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

The associated closure models are based on multiple simplifying assumptions and involve numerous empirical closure coefficients, which are calibrated on a set of simple reference flows. Predicting new flows using a single closure model with nominal values for the closure coefficients may lead to biased predictions. Bayesian model-scenario averaging is a statistical technique providing an optimal way to combine the predictions of several competing models calibrated on various sets of data (scenarios). The method allows a stochastic estimate of a quantity of interest in an unmeasured prediction scenario to be obtain by 1) propagating posterior probability distributions of the parameters obtained for multiple calibration scenarios, and 2) computing a weighted posterior predictive distribution.

Then, we review high dimensional Bayesian methods with a particular emphasis on Bayesian regularization methods, which have been used extensively in recent years.

abstract = {The response of homogeneous turbulence to rapid mean-flow compression in idealized internal combustion engines and rapid compression machines is examined using a hierarchy of closure models for the Reynolds stress anisotropy. This hierarchy is based on a Reynolds stress anisotropy transport equation that is modeled from the exact transport equation for the anisotropy. The hierarchy of models includes a recently- developed non-equilibrium model, which is shown to be in good agreement with more computationally-complex fully differential models. Using this hierarchical approach, the flow physics addressed by each closure is identified and closure accuracy is shown to depend on the degree to which non-equilibrium turbulent flow effects are captured. We examine the evolution of the turbulence kinetic energy, Reynolds stresses, and anisotropy as a function of the degree of non-equilibrium in the flow, which is parameterized by the ratio of characteristic turbulence and mean-flow deformation time scales. By comparing model results to results obtained from rapid distortion theory and higher level closures, prescriptions are provided for the applicability of different closure models based on the magnitude of the non-equilibrium parameter. The theoretical analysis is complemented by comparisons of simulation results with previously established direct numerical simulations for a one-dimensional compression. Finally,we connect these prescriptions with experimen- tal measurements of turbulent and mean-flow time scales for internal combustion engines operating at realistic conditions. Keywords},

abstract = {The backward-facing step is frequently employed in the study of turbulent reattachment for its geometrical simplicity. However, in spite of the large amount of experimental work, the physics of the reattachment is not fully understood. The objective of this study is to conduct a direct numerical simulation of turbulent backward-facing step flow and to provide data, in the recirculation and reattachment regions, in the form of Reynolds stress budgets for Reynolds averaged modeling. In 2-D simulations, different velocity profiles were applied at the step. The flow is steady at low Reynolds numbers. At high Reynolds number, the flow becomes quasi periodic even though no fluctuations were imposed at the inlet. The oscillation can also be resulted from a poor grid resolution or imposed inlet velocity fluctuations. The Strouhal number based on the step height and maximum inlet velocity is approximately 0.08, and is the same in all cases. The main 3-D simulation was conducted at a Reynolds number of 5100 based on the step height h and inlet free-stream velocity, and an expansion ratio of 1.20. Spanwise-averaged pressure fluctuation contours and reattachment lengths show evidence of an approximate oscillatory behavior of the free shear layer with a Strouhal number of 0.06. The mean reattachment length is 6.2h. Statistical results show excellent agreement with experimental data by Jovic {\&} Driver (1994). Of interest are two observations not previously reported for the backward-facing step flow: (a) at the relatively low Reynolds number considered, large negative skin friction is seen in the recirculation region; (b) the velocity profiles in the recovery region fall below the universal log-law, indicating that the turbulent boundary layer is not fully recovered at 20 step heights behind the separation. The budgets of all Reynolds stress components have been computed. The turbulent kinetic energy budget in the recirculation region is similar to that of a turbulent mixing layer. The turbulent transport term makes a significant contribution to the budget and the peak dissipation is about 60{\%} of the peak production. The velocity pressure-gradient and viscous diffusion are negligible in the shear layer, but both are significant in the near-wall region. A large database from this simulation has been archived. It contains up to third-order statistics, and the budgets of the Reynolds stress tensor.},

abstract = {This dissertation describes research on the graphical presentation of relational information. It presents theoretical results about graphical languages and a program that incorporates these results. According to the theory, a graphical language is a set of graphical sentences (such as bar charts, scatter plots, or connected graphs), each of which is a two dimensional arrangement of pixel objects. These languages are evaluated on the basis of two graphic design criteria: expressiveness is an indication of the kinds of relational information that can be expressed in a language, and effectiveness deals with the relative desirability of sentences from alternative graphical languages. A composition algebra is also developed that can be used to systematically generate a wide variety of graphical languages from a small set of primitives. These theoretical results are incorporated into a graphical presentation program called APT (A Presentation Tool). APT is unique in that its designs are sensitive to both the structure of the information and the output medium. The design process has three parts. First, the information is divided into components, each of which satisfies the expressiveness criterion for a primitive graphical language. Next, effectiveness criteria are used to select the most effective primitive graphical language for each component. Finally, composition operators are used to compose the individual designs into a unified presentation of all of the information. Even though only a few primitives are implemented, APT can synthesize a wide variety of designs that express information effectively.},

abstract = {—Inferring the structure and dynamics of network models is critical to understanding the functionality and control of complex systems, such as metabolic and regulatory biological networks. The increasing quality and quantity of experimental data enable statistical approaches based on information theory for model selection and goodness-of-fit metrics. We propose an alternative data-driven method to infer networked nonlinear dynamical systems by using sparsity-promoting optimization to select a subset of nonlinear interactions representing dynamics on a network. In contrast to standard model selection methods-based upon information content for a finite number of heuristic models (order 10 or less), our model selection procedure discov-ers a parsimonious model from a combinatorially large set of models, without an exhaustive search. Our particular innovation is appropriate for many biological networks, where the govern-ing dynamical systems have rational function nonlinearities with cross terms, thus requiring an implicit formulation and the equa-tions to be identified in the null-space of a library of mixed nonlinearities, including the state and derivative terms. This method, implicit-SINDy, succeeds in inferring three canonical biological models: 1) Michaelis–Menten enzyme kinetics; 2) the regulatory network for competence in bacteria; and 3) the metabolic network for yeast glycolysis.},

However, both are generally considered `black box' predictors as the non-linear transformations involved have so far prevented transparent and interpretable reasoning. Recently, a principled technique, Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP), has been developed in order to better comprehend the inherent structured reasoning of complex nonlinear classification models such as Bag of Feature models or DNNs. In this paper we (1) extend the LRP framework also for Fisher Vector classifiers and then use it as analysis tool to (2) quantify the importance of context for classification, (3) qualitatively compare DNNs against FV classifiers in terms of important image regions and (4) detect potential flaws and biases in data.

Symbolic regression is a useful method to construct the data-driven model (regression equation). Existing algorithms for symbolic regression such as genetic programming and grammatical evolution are difficult to use due to their special target programming language (i.e.; LISP) or additional function parsing process. In this paper, a new evolutionary algorithm, parse-matrix evolution (PME), for symbolic regression is proposed. A chromosome in PME is a parse-matrix with integer entries. The mapping process from the chromosome to the regression equation is based on a mapping table. PME can easily be implemented in any programming language and free to control. Furthermore, it does not need any additional function parsing process. Numerical results show that PME can solve the symbolic regression problems effectively. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The present study aims at quantifying the uncertainty related to the variability in the inflow boundary conditions for Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) simulations of the flow in downtown Oklahoma City to address validation with the Joint Urban 2003 field measurements. Three uncertain inflow parameters were defined: the wind speed and wind direction at a reference height, and the aerodynamic roughness in the logarithmic velocity inlet profile. An ensemble of 729 RANS simulations were performed to determine the polynomial chaos expansion coefficients that define the response surfaces for the velocity magnitude and direction at 13 field measurement stations, and the results are compared to the experimental data. For the velocity magnitude the mean experimental velocity magnitude is encompassed within the 95{\%} confidence interval for the magnitudes predicted by the Uncertainty Quantification study in all stations. For the velocity direction this holds in 11 out of 13 locations. The study demonstrates the significant potential of applying advanced uncertainty quantification methods to address validation with field measurements and to develop a more realistic approach to the definition of inflow boundary conditions in atmospheric CFD simulations. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Turbulence modeling is a critical component in numerical simulations of industrial flows based on Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations. However, after decades of efforts in the turbulence modeling community, universally applicable RANS models with predictive capabilities are still lacking. Recently, data-driven methods have been proposed as a promising alternative to the traditional approaches of turbulence model development. In this work we propose a data-driven, physics-informed machine learning approach for predicting discrepancies in RANS modeled Reynolds stresses. The discrepancies are formulated as functions of the mean flow features. By using a modern machine learning technique based on random forests, the discrepancy functions are first trained with benchmark flow data and then used to predict Reynolds stresses discrepancies in new flows. The method is used to predict the Reynolds stresses in the flow over periodic hills by using two training flow scenarios of increasing difficulties: (1) the flow in the same periodic hills geometry yet at a lower Reynolds number, and (2) the flow in a different hill geometry with a similar recirculation zone. Excellent predictive performances were observed in both scenarios, demonstrating the merits of the proposed method. Improvement of RANS modeled Reynolds stresses enabled by the proposed method is an important step towards predictive turbulence modeling, where the ultimate goal is to predict the quantities of interest (e.g., velocity field, drag, lift) more accurately by solving RANS equations with the Reynolds stresses obtained therefrom.},

abstract = {Since inverse problems are usually ill-posed it is necessary to use some method to reduce their deficiencies. The method that we choose is the regularization by derivative matrices. When a first derivative matrix is used the order is called the first. Then, second-order regularization is when the matrix is formed by second-order differences, and order zero means that the regularization matrix is the identity. There is a crucial problem in regularization, which is the selection of the regularization parameter $\lambda$. We used the L-curve as a tool for the selection of $\lambda$, and we propose a new extension, which we call the $\Theta$-curve. The tool was applied in geophysical diffraction tomography in two acquisition geometries: cross-hole and vertical seismic profile (VSP), where the goal is to obtain the 2-D velocity distribution from the measured values of the scattered acoustic field. We present several simulation results with synthetic data, for the three regularization orders mentioned above. We validate the necessity of some kind of regularization, as well as the feasibility of both parameter selection approaches. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations are widely used in engineering turbulent flow simulations. However, RANS predictions may have large discrepancies due to the uncertainties in modeled Reynolds stresses. Recently, Wang et al. demonstrated that machine learning can be used to improve the RANS modeled Reynolds stresses by leveraging data from high fidelity simulations (Physics informed machine learning approach for reconstructing Reynolds stress modeling discrepancies based on DNS data. Physical Review Fluids. 2, 034603, 2017). However, solving for mean flows from the improved Reynolds stresses still poses significant challenges due to potential ill-conditioning of RANS equations with Reynolds stress closures. Enabling improved predictions of mean velocities are of profound practical importance, because often the velocity and its derived quantities (QoIs, e.g., drag, lift, surface friction), and not the Reynolds stress itself, are of ultimate interest in RANS simulations. To this end, we present a comprehensive framework for augmenting turbulence models with physics-informed machine learning, illustrating a complete workflow from identification of input features to final prediction of mean velocities. This work has two innovations. First, we demonstrate a systematic procedure to generate mean flow features based on the integrity basis for mean flow tensors. Second, we propose using machine learning to predict linear and nonlinear parts of the Reynolds stress tensor separately. Inspired by the finite polynomial representation of tensors in classical turbulence modeling, such a decomposition is instrumental in overcoming the ill-conditioning of RANS equations. Numerical tests demonstrated merits of the proposed framework.},

abstract = {Although Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations are still the dominant tool for engineering design and analysis applications involving turbulent flows, standard RANS models are known to be unreliable in many flows of engineering relevance, including flows with separation, strong pressure gradients or mean flow curvature. With increasing amounts of 3-dimensional experimental data and high fidelity simulation data from Large Eddy Simulation (LES) and Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS), data-driven turbulence modeling has become a promising approach to increase the predictive capability of RANS simulations. Recently, a data-driven turbulence modeling approach via machine learning has been proposed to predict the Reynolds stress anisotropy of a given flow based on high fidelity data from closely related flows. In this work, the closeness of different flows is investigated to assess the prediction confidence a priori. Specifically, the Mahalanobis distance and the kernel density estimation (KDE) technique are used as metrics to quantify the distance between flow data sets in feature space. The flow over periodic hills at Re=10595 is used as the test set and seven flows with different configurations are individually used as training set. The results show that the prediction error of the Reynolds stress anisotropy is positively correlated with Mahalanobis distance and KDE distance, demonstrating that both extrapolation metrics can be used to estimate the prediction confidence a priori. A quantitative comparison using correlation coefficients shows that the Mahalanobis distance is less accurate in estimating the prediction confidence than KDE distance. The extrapolation metrics introduced in this work and the corresponding analysis provide an approach to aid in the choice of the data source and to assess the prediction confidence for data-driven turbulence modeling.},

abstract = {A numerical study of scalar dispersion is presented to investigate the effectiveness of pairing the v2-f turbulence model with algebraic models for the scalar flux. This approach is contrasted with utilizing a full Second Moment Closure (SMC) as the flow field input to the scalar model. Predictions of scalar transport in a turbulent channel and over a wavy wall are compared to available DNS databases. The latter case includes a scalar release from a point source and therefore detailed comparisons of the three-component turbulent scalar flux are reported. It is found that the transported variable v2, representing the near wall turbulent velocity fluctuation scale, can be used to increase the level of normal stress anisotropy provided to algebraic scalar models and thereby improve mean scalar prediction over that of the Standard Gradient Diffusion Hypothesis (SGDH). Improvement is most significant in the near wall region. Three specifications of the normal stresses, derived from v2, are considered to provide the link from the v2-f model to the algebraic flux models used to close the scalar transport equation. Barycentric maps are used to examine the state of turbulence anisotropy in each case. As the anisotropy in the normal stress specification becomes more accurate, improvements are realized in the prediction of the spanwise flux as well as the mean concentration. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART) is a statistical sum of trees model. It can be considered a Bayesian version of machine learning tree ensemble methods where the individual trees are the base learners. However for data sets where the number of variables {\$}p{\$} is large (e.g. {\$}p{\textgreater}5,000{\$}) the algorithm can become prohibitively expensive, computationally. Another method which is popular for high dimensional data is random forests, a machine learning algorithm which grows trees using a greedy search for the best split points. However, as it is not a statistical model, it cannot produce probabilistic estimates or predictions. We propose an alternative algorithm for BART called BART-BMA, which uses Bayesian Model Averaging and a greedy search algorithm to produce a model which is much more efficient than BART for datasets with large {\$}p{\$}. BART-BMA incorporates elements of both BART and random forests to offer a model-based algorithm which can deal with high-dimensional data. We have found that BART-BMA can be run in a reasonable time on a standard laptop for the "small {\$}n{\$} large {\$}p{\$}" scenario which is common in many areas of bioinformatics. We showcase this method using simulated data and data from two real proteomic experiments; one to distinguish between patients with cardiovascular disease and controls and another to classify agressive from non-agressive prostate cancer. We compare our results to their main competitors. Open source code written in R and Rcpp to run BART-BMA can be found at: https://github.com/BelindaHernandez/BART-BMA.git},

abstract = {Coherent techniques for searches of gravitational-wave bursts effectively combine data from several detectors, taking into account differences in their responses. The efforts are now focused on the maximum likelihood principle as the most natural way to combine data, which can also be used without prior knowledge of the signal. Recent studies however have shown that straightforward application of the maximum likelihood method to gravitational waves with unknown waveforms can lead to inconsistencies and unphysical results such as discontinuity in the residual functional, or divergence of the variance of the estimated waveforms for some locations in the sky. So far the solutions to these problems have been based on rather different physical arguments. Following these investigations, we now find that all these inconsistencies stem from rank deficiency of the underlying network response matrix. In this paper we show that the detection of gravitational-wave bursts with a network of interferometers belongs to the category of ill-posed problems. We then apply the method of Tikhonov regularization to resolve the rank deficiency and introduce a minimal regulator which yields a well-conditioned solution to the inverse problem for all locations on the sky.},

@article{Spalart2015a,
abstract = {We present a set of positions, likely to be controversial, on turbulence modeling for the Reynolds-Averaged Navier Stokes (RANS) equations. The paper has three themes. First is what we call the "fundamental paradox" of turbulence modeling, between the local character of the Partial Differential Equations strongly favored by CFD methods and the nonlocal physical nature of turbulence. Second, we oppose two philosophies. The "Systematic" philosophy attempts to model the exact transport equations for the Reynolds stresses or possibly higher moments term by term, gradually relegating the Closure Problem to higher moments and invoking the "Principle of Receding Influence" (although rarely formulating it). In contrast, the "Openly Empirical" philosophy produces models which satisfy strict constraints such as Galilean invariance, but lack an explicit connection with terms in the exact turbulence equations. The prime example is the eddy-viscosity assumption. Third, we explain a series of what we perceive as fallacies, many of them widely held and by senior observers, in turbulence knowledge, leading to turbulence models. We divide them into "hard" fallacies for which a short mathematical argument demonstrates that a particular statement is wrong or meaningless, and "soft" fallacies for which approximate physical arguments can be opposed, but we contend that a clear debate is overdue and wishful thinking has been involved. Some fallacies appear to be "intermediate." An example in the hard class is the supposed isotropy of the diagonal Reynolds stresses. Examples in the soft class are the need to match the decay rate of isotropic turbulence, and the value of realizability in a model. Our hope is to help the direct effort in this field away from simplistic and hopeless lines of work, and to foster debates.},

The new Baseline (BSL) model is designed to give results similar to those of the original k -w model of Wilcox, but without its strong dependency on arbitrary freestream values. The BSL model is identical to the Wilcox model in the inner 50{\%} of the boundary-layer but changes gradually to the standard k -model (in a k -w formulation) towards the boundary-layer edge. The new model is also virtually identical to the k -6 model Cor free shear layers. The second version of the model is called Shear-Stress Transport (SST) model. It is a variation of the BSL model with the additional ability to account for the trnnsport of the principal turbulent shear stress in adverse pressure gradient bound,uy-layers. The model is based on Bradshaw's assumption that the principal shear-stress is pro-portional to the turbulent kinetic energy, which is introduced into the definition of the eddy-viscosity. Both models are tested for a lnrge number of different flowfields. The results of the BSL model are similar to those of the original k -w model, but without the undesirable freestream dependency. The predictions of the SST model are also independent of the freestream values hut show better agreement with exper-imental data for adverse pressure gradient boundary-layer flows.},

abstract = {In contrast to rapid advances in computing, numerical methods and visualisation, the predictive capabilities of statistical models of turbulence are limited and improve only slowly, despite much intensive research in the recent past. The intuitive nature of turbulence modelling, its strong reliance on calibration and validation, the extreme sensitivity of model performance to seemingly minor variations in modelling details and flow conditions, and the fact that the non-local dynamics of turbulence are not well captured by single-point closure, all conspire to make turbulence modelling an especially demanding component of CFD, but one that is crucially important for the correct prediction of complex flows. This applies in particular to separation from streamlined bodies, which is, from a computational point of view, the most challenging flow feature in aeronautical CFD. This paper reviews some aspects of the foundation and application of turbulence models to flows that relate to aeronautical practice, with particular emphasis being placed on turbulence-transport models at a closure level higher than that based on the Boussinesq-viscosity hypothesis. Following a review of basic modelling issues, including aspects of linear-eddy-viscosity two-equation modelling, some recent experience and current work on predicting separation from continuous surfaces with non-linear eddy-viscosity models and second-moment closure are reported. The predictive performance of several anisotropy-resolving models is illustrated by reference to computational solutions for a number of flows, both two- and three-dimensional, some compressible and others incompressible. ?? 2005 The Japan Society of Fluid Mechanics and Elsevier B.V.

It re-iterates some important quotes made by CWE and/or CFD researchers in the past, many of which are still equally valid today and which are provided without additional comments, to let the quotes speak for themselves. Next, as application examples to the foregoing sections, the paper provides a more detailed view on CFD simulation of pedestrian-level wind conditions around buildings, CFD simulation of natural ventilation of buildings and CFD simulation of wind-driven rain on building facades.

In particular, new methodologies recently allowed the achievement of high Reynolds number in DNS of the benchmark plane channel flow. In this scenario, estimating the statistical errors associated with DNS is a difficult but necessary task. Here, we present a methodology to evaluate the statistical errors of the second-moment DNS data. In this methodology, the momentum balance equation is used to calculate the mean velocity profile by considering the Reynolds stress tensor provided by DNS. This error evaluation was applied to different plane channel flow databases available in the literature. We show that using the Reynolds stress statistics obtained from standard DNS can lead to significant discrepancies for turbulence modeling. One interesting consequence of this approach is that we are able to compute the Reynolds shear stress from the converged first order statistic. This information can be used, for instance, to extract a more accurate turbulent viscosity for turbulence modeling purposes. Moreover, the new methodology seems to be a promising path to formulate a convergence criterion for future plane channel DNS.},

In contrast to inferring model parameters, this work uses inverse modeling to obtain corrective, spatially distributed functional terms, offering a route to directly address model-form errors. Once the inference has been performed over a number of problems that are representative of the deficient physics in the closure model, machine learning techniques are used to reconstruct the model corrections in terms of variables that appear in the closure model. These reconstructed functional forms are then used to augment the closure model in a predictive computational setting. As a first demonstrative example, a scalar ordinary differential equation is considered, wherein the model equation has missing and deficient terms. Following this, the methodology is extended to the prediction of turbulent channel flow. In both of these applications, the approach is demonstrated to be able to successfully reconstruct functional corrections and yield accurate predictive solutions while providing a measure of model form uncertainties.},

We are interested in the problem of identifying those basis functions with non-zero coefficients and reconstructing the target function from noisy observations. Two heuristics that are widely used in practice are forward and backward greedy algorithms. First, we show that neither idea is adequate. Second, we propose a novel combination that is based on the forward greedy algorithm but takes backward steps adaptively whenever beneficial. We prove strong theoretical results showing that this procedure is effective in learning sparse representations. Experimental results support our theory.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 by ASME.Linear eddy-viscosity Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) turbulence models are based on the Boussinesq approximation that asserts the Reynolds stresses to be linearly dependent on the mean strain rate. Using the Boussinesq approximation for the Reynolds stress yields a production term in the turbulent kinetic energy equation that is proportional to the square of the magnitude of the strain rate tensor. For some flows, this relation to the strain causes overproduction of turbulence. Widely used ad hoc modifications of the production term using vorticity lead to an inconsistent energy balance in the mean flow kinetic energy equation, violating the energy conservation. In this note, how to obtain a consistent RANS framework for a given production term modification is shown.},

@article{Jasak1996,
abstract = {The accuracy of numerical simulation algorithms is one of main concerns in modern Computational Fluid Dynamics. Development of new and more accurate mathe- matical models requires an insight into the problem of numerical errors. In order to construct an estimate of the solution error in Finite Volume calculations, it is first necessary to examine its sources. Discretisation errors can be divided into two groups: errors caused by the discretisation of the solution domain and equation discretisation errors. The first group includes insufficient mesh reso- lution, mesh skewness and non-orthogonality. In the case of the second order Finite Volume method, equation discretisation errors are represented through numerical diffusion. Numerical diffusion coefficients from the discretisation of the convection term and the temporal derivative are derived. In an attempt to reduce numeri- cal diffusion from the convection term, a new stabilised and bounded second-order differencing scheme is proposed. Three new methods of error estimation are presented. The Direct Taylor Series Error estimate is based on the Taylor series truncation error analysis. It is set up to enable single-mesh single-run error estimation. The Moment Error estimate derives the solution error from the cell imbalance in higher moments of the solution. A suitable normalisation is used to estimate the error magnitude. The Residual Error estimate is based on the local inconsistency between face interpolation and volume integration. Extensions of the method to transient flows and the Local Residual Problem error estimate are also given. Finally, an automatic error-controlled adaptive mesh refinement algorithm is set up in order to automatically produce a solution of pre-determined accuracy. It uses mesh refinement and unrefinement to control the local error magnitude. The method is tested on several characteristic flow situations, ranging from incompressible to supersonic flows, for both steady-state and transient problems.},

abstract = {The principle of material frame-indifference (MFI) is a fundamental and controversial principle of continuum mechanics that has been invoked recently to derive nonlinear algebraic models for stresses of viscoelastic liquids. The purpose of the present study is to identify regions of a flow field where MFI should be considered. Such regions are identified by computing the angular velocity of the principal directions of the rate-of-deformation tensor in order to obtain an Euclidean objective vorticity tensor. An analysis is carried out for uniform shear and extensional flows, and for a Couette flow. The method is then applied to the planar flow through an abrupt 4 : I contraction and to the two-dimensional stream past a circular cylinder. The main results are: (1) MFI should be taken into account in regions characterized by the transition between two different kinematics and a significant velocity magnitude, and (2) MFI can be safely ignored in regions of pure viscometric behaviour as well as in recirculation regions. The consequences of MFI being taken into account are then examined upon using the Euclidean objective vorticity tensor in a simple algebraic constitutive law for viscoelastic fluids.},

It provides an overview of the key challenges that face scientific and engineering communities in the context of huge databases of turbulence information currently being generated, yet poorly mined. These challenges include coherent structures and their control, wall turbulence and control, multi-scale turbulence, the impact of turbulence on energy generation and turbulence data manipulation strategies. The motivation for this volume is to assist the reader to make physical sense of these data deluges so as to inform both the research community as well as to advance practical outcomes from what is learned. Outcomes presented in this collection provide industry with information that impacts their activities, such as minimizing impact of wind farms, opportunities for understanding large scale wind events and large eddy simulation of the hydrodynamics of bays and lakes thereby increasing energy efficiencies, and minimizing emissions and noise from jet engines. Elucidates established, contemporary, and novel aspects of fluid turbulence - a ubiquitous yet poorly understood phenomena; Explores computer simulation of turbulence in the context of the emerging, unprecedented profusion of experimental data,which will need to be stewarded and archived; Examines a compendium of problems and issues that investigators can use to help formulate new promising research ideas; Makes the case for why funding agencies and scientists around the world need to lead a global effort to establish and steward large stores of turbulence data, rather than leaving them to individual researchers. {\textcopyright} Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2017.

Using a supervised machine learning strategy, library elements encoding the dimensionally reduced dynamics are computed for various Reynolds numbers. Convex L1 optimization is then used with a limited number of pressure measurements on the cylinder to reconstruct, or decode, the full pressure field and the resulting flow field around the cylinder. Aside from the highly turbulent regime (large Reynolds number) where only the Reynolds number can be identified, accurate reconstruction of the pressure field and Reynolds number is achieved. The proposed data-driven strategy thus achieves encoding of the fluid dynamics using the L2 norm, and robust decoding (flowfield reconstruction) using the sparsity promoting L1 norm.

abstract = {This paper presents a new data-driven adaptive computational model for simulating turbulent flow, where partial-but-incomplete measurement data is available. The model automatically adjusts the closure coefficients of the Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) k–$\omega$ turbulence equations to improve agreement between the simulated flow and the measurements. This data-driven adaptive RANS k–$\omega$ (D-DARK) model is validated with 3 canonical flow geometries: pipe flow, backward-facing step, and flow around an airfoil. For all test cases, the D-DARK model improves agreement with experimental data in comparison to the results from a non-adaptive RANS k–$\omega$ model that uses standard values of the closure coefficients. For the pipe flow, adaptation is driven by mean stream-wise velocity data from 42 measurement locations along the pipe radius, and the D-DARK model reduces the average error from 5.2{\%} to 1.1{\%}. For the 2-dimensional backward-facing step, adaptation is driven by mean stream-wise velocity data from 100 measurement locations at 4 cross-sections of the flow. In this case, D-DARK reduces the average error from 40{\%} to 12{\%}. For the NACA 0012 airfoil, adaptation is driven by surface-pressure data at 25 measurement locations. The D-DARK model reduces the average error in surface-pressure coefficients from 45{\%} to 12{\%}.},

abstract = {Ten international laboratories specializing in the determination of marine pigment concentrations using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) were intercompared using in situ samples and a mixed pigment sample. Although prior Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS) High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) Round-Robin Experiment (SeaHARRE) activities conducted in open-ocean waters covered a wide dynamic range in productivity, and some of the samples were collected in the coastal zone, none of the activities involved exclusively coastal samples. Consequently, SeaHARRE-4 was organized and executed as a strictly coastal activity and the field samples were collected from primarily eutrophic waters within the coastal zone of Denmark. The more restrictive perspective limited the dynamic range in chlorophyll concentration to approximately one and a half orders of magnitude (previous activities covered more than two orders of magnitude). The method intercomparisons were used for the following objectives: a) estimate the uncertainties in quantitating individual pigments and higher-order variables formed from sums and ratios; b) confirm if the chlorophyll a accuracy requirements for ocean color validation activities (approximately 25{\%}, although 15{\%} would allow for algorithm refinement) can be met in coastal waters; c) establish the reduction in uncertainties as a result of applying QA procedures; d) show the importance of establishing a properly defined referencing system in the computation of uncertainties; e) quantify the analytical benefits of performance metrics, and f) demonstrate the utility of a laboratory mix in understanding method performance. In addition, the remote sensing requirements for the in situ determination of total chlorophyll a were investigated to determine whether or not the average uncertainty for this measurement is being satisfied.},

abstract = {Wing-body junction flows occur when a boundary layer encounters an airfoil mounted on the surface. The corner flow near the trailing edge is challenging for the linear eddy viscosity Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) models, due to the interaction of two perpendicular boundary layers which leads to highly anisotropic Reynolds stress at the near wall region. Recently, Xiao et al. proposed a physics-informed Bayesian framework to quantify and reduce the model-form uncertainties in RANS simulations by utilizing sparse observation data. In this work, we extend this framework to incorporate the use of wall function in RANS simulations, and apply the extended framework to the RANS simulation of wing-body junction flow. Standard RANS simulations are performed on a 3:2 elliptic nose and NACA0020 tail cylinder joined at their maximum thickness location. Current results show that both the posterior mean velocity and the Reynolds stress anisotropy show better agreement with the experimental data at the corner region near the trailing edge. On the other hand, the prior velocity profiles at the leading edge indicate the restriction of uncertainty space and the performance of the framework at this region is less effective. By perturbing the orientation of Reynolds stress, the uncertainty range of prior velocity profiles at the leading edge covers the experimental data. It indicates that the uncertainty of RANS predicted velocity field is more related to the uncertainty in the orientation of Reynolds stress at the region with rapid change of mean strain rate. The present work not only demonstrates the capability of Bayesian framework in improving the RANS simulation of wing-body junction flow, but also reveals the major source of model-form uncertainty for this flow, which can be useful in assisting RANS modeling.},

abstract = {The estimation of EEG generating sources constitutes an Inverse Problem (IP) in Neuroscience. This is an ill-posed problem due to the non-uniqueness of the solution and regularization or prior information is needed to undertake Electrophysiology Source Imaging. Structured Sparsity priors can be attained through combinations of (L1 norm-based) and (L2 norm-based) constraints such as the Elastic Net (ENET) and Elitist Lasso (ELASSO) models. The former model is used to find solutions with a small number of smooth nonzero patches, while the latter imposes different degrees of sparsity simultaneously along different dimensions of the spatio-temporal matrix solutions. Both models have been addressed within the penalized regression approach, where the regularization parameters are selected heuristically, leading usually to non-optimal and computationally expensive solutions. The existing Bayesian formulation of ENET allows hyperparameter learning, but using the computationally intensive Monte Carlo/Expectation Maximization methods, which makes impractical its application to the EEG IP. While the ELASSO have not been considered before into the Bayesian context. In this work, we attempt to solve the EEG IP using a Bayesian framework for ENET and ELASSO models. We propose a Structured Sparse Bayesian Learning algorithm based on combining the Empirical Bayes and the iterative coordinate descent procedures to estimate both the parameters and hyperparameters. Using realistic simulations and avoiding the inverse crime we illustrate that our methods are able to recover complicated source setupsmore accurately and with amore robust estimation of the hyperparameters and behavior under different sparsity scenarios than classical LORETA, ENET and LASSO Fusion solutions. We also solve the EEG IP using data from a visual attention experiment, finding more interpretable neurophysiological patterns with our methods.

Engineering models, on the other hand, require many assumptions that may result in a biased risk assessment. In two related papers we show how engineering and data-driven modelling can be combined by developing generic risk models that are calibrated to statistical data on observed fire events. The focus of the present paper is on the calibration procedure. A framework is developed that is able to deal with data collection in non-homogeneous portfolios of buildings. Also incomplete data sets containing only little information on each fire event can be used for model calibration. To illustrate the capabilities of the proposed framework, it is applied to the calibration of a generic fire risk model for single family houses to Swiss insurance data. The example demonstrates that the bias in the risk estimation can be strongly reduced by model calibration.},

abstract = {Dynamical weather and climate prediction models underpin many studies of the Earth system and hold the promise of being able to make robust projections of future climate change based on physical laws. However, simulations from these models still show many differences compared with observations. Machine learning has been applied to solve certain prediction problems with great success, and recently it's been proposed that this could replace the role of physically-derived dynamical weather and climate models to give better quality simulations. Here, instead, a framework using machine learning together with physically-derived models is tested, in which it is learnt how to correct the errors of the latter from timestep to timestep. This maintains the physical understanding built into the models, whilst allowing performance improvements, and also requires much simpler algorithms and less training data. This is tested in the context of simulating the chaotic Lorenz '96 system, and it is shown that the approach yields models that are stable and that give both improved skill in initialised predictions and better long-term climate statistics. Improvements in long-term statistics are smaller than for single time-step tendencies, however, indicating that it would be valuable to develop methods that target improvements on longer time scales. Future strategies for the development of this approach and possible applications to making progress on important scientific problems are discussed.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc. All rights reserved. A novel approach to turbulence model development is applied to formulate a Hybrid RANS/LES methodology suitable on coarse meshes. The Reynolds-stress damping function in the Flow Simulation Methodology (FSM) framework is difficult to formulate rigorously from first principles, however it is critical to the success of the model. The damping function dictates locally and instantaneously the contribution level of a RANS model required to supplement structures resolved by the grid. The current formulation is a damping of the turbulent length scale in a nonlinear explicit algebraic stress RANS closure. This turns the eddy viscosity into a sub-grid scale model. In this proposal Symbolic Regression, an evolutionary process according to survival of the fittest, is used to build a new damping function. A population of randomly generated damping functions is evolved by measuring how closely they represent an idealized form. This ideal dataset is generated by filtering DNS to represent a pseudo FSM flow field. In the present study DNS of a turbulent pipe flow is used. Hybrid RANS/LES using the new damping function is performed on two different test cases. Results are presented on coarse meshes for two dimensional periodic hills and inline tandem cylinders, for which the modified FSM performs very well.},

abstract = {An algebraic relation for the scalar flux, in terms of mean flow quantities, is formed by applying an equilibrium condition in the transport equations for the normalized scalar flux. This modeling approach is analogous to explicit algebraic Reynolds stress modeling (EARSM) for the Reynolds stressanisotropies. The assumption of negligible advection and diffusion of the normalized passive scalar flux gives, in general, an implicit, nonlinear set of algebraic equations. A method to solve this implicit relation in a fully explicit form is proposed, where the nonlinearity in the scalar-production-to-dissipation ratio is considered and solved. The nonlinearity, in the algebraic equations for the normalized scalar fluxes, may be eliminated directly by using a nonlinear term in the model of the pressure scalar-gradient correlation and the destruction and thus results in a much simpler model for both two-and three-dimensional mean flows. The performance of the present model is investigated in three different flow situations. These are homogeneous shear flow with an imposed mean scalar gradient, turbulent channel flow, and the flow field downstream a heated cylinder. The direct numerical simulation (DNS) data are used to analyze the passive scalar flux in the homogeneous shear and channel flow cases and experimental data are used in the case of the heated cylinder wake. Sets of parameter values giving very good predictions in all three cases are found.},

abstract = {New turbulence and turbulent heat flux models are proposed for capturing flow and thermal fields bounded by walls or free surfaces. The models are constructed using locally definable quantities only, without any recourse to topographical parameters. For the flow field, the proposed model is a cubic nonlinear k-??-A three equation eddy viscosity model. It employs dependence on Lumley's stress flatness parameter A, by solving its modelled transport equation as the third variable. Since A vanishes at two-component turbulence boundaries, introducing its dependency enables a turbulence model to capture the structure of turbulence near shear-free surfaces as well as wall boundaries. To close the modelled A equation, an up-to-date second-moment closure is applied. For the thermal field, an explicit algebraic second-moment closure for turbulent heat flux is proposed. The new aspect of this heat flux model is the use of nonlinear Reynolds stress terms in the eddy diffusivity tensor. This model complies with the linearity and independence principles for passive scalar. The proposed models are tested in fully developed plane channel; open channel and plane Couette-Poiseuille flows at several fluid Prandtl numbers. The results show the very encouraging performance of the present proposals in capturing anisotropic turbulence and thermal fields near both wall and shear-free boundaries in the range of 0.025???Pr???95.

abstract = {Machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms are now being used to automate the discovery of physics principles and governing equations from measurement data alone. However, positing a universal physical law from data is challenging without simultaneously proposing an accompanying discrepancy model to account for the inevitable mismatch between theory and measurements. By revisiting the classic problem of modeling falling objects of different size and mass, we highlight a number of subtle and nuanced issues that must be addressed by modern data-driven methods for the automated discovery of physics. Specifically, we show that measurement noise and complex secondary physical mechanisms, such as unsteady fluid drag forces, can obscure the underlying law of gravitation, leading to an erroneous model. Without proposing an appropriate discrepancy model to handle these drag forces, the data supports an Aristotelian, versus a Galilean, theory of gravitation. Using the sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) algorithm, with the additional assumption that each separate falling object is governed by the same physical law, we are able to identify a viable discrepancy model to account for the fluid dynamic forces that explain the mismatch between a posited universal law of gravity and the measurement data. This work highlights the fact that the simple application of ML/AI will generally be insufficient to extract universal physical laws without further modification.},

The challenge in {\$}l{\_}0{\$} regularization is optimizing a non-convex objective function via search over model space consisting of all possible predictor combinations, a NP-hard task. Spike-and-slab (a.k.a. Bernoulli-Gaussian, BG) priors are the gold standard for Bayesian variable selection, with a caveat of computational speed and scalability. We show that a Single Best Replacement (SBR) algorithm is a fast scalable alternative. Although SBR calculates a sparse posterior mode, we show that it possesses a number of equivalences and optimality properties of a posterior mean. To illustrate our methodology, we provide simulation evidence and a real data example on the statistical properties and computational efficiency of SBR versus direct posterior sampling using spike-and-slab priors. Finally, we conclude with directions for future research.},

abstract = {Abstract Oceanographic observations are limited by sampling rates, while ocean models are limited by finite resolution and high viscosity and diffusion coefficients. Therefore both data from observations and ocean models lack information at small- and fast-scales. Methods are needed to either extract information, extrapolate, or up-scale existing oceanographic datasets, to account for or represent unresolved physical processes. Here we use machine learning to leverage observations and model data by predicting unresolved turbulent processes and sub-surface flow fields. As a proof-of-concept, we train convolutional neural networks on degraded-data from a high-resolution quasi-geostrophic ocean model. We demonstrate that convolutional neural networks successfully replicate the spatio-temporal variability of the sub-grid eddy momentum forcing, are capable of generalising to a range of dynamical behaviours, and can be forced to respect global momentum conservation. The training data of our convolutional neural networks can be sub-sampled to 10-20{\%} of the original size without a significant decrease in accuracy. We also show that the sub-surface flow field can be predicted using only information at the surface (e.g., using only satellite altimetry data). Our study indicates that data-driven approaches can be exploited to predict both sub-grid and large-scale processes, while respecting physical principles, even when data is limited to a particular region or external forcing. Our in-depth study presents evidence for the successful design of ocean eddy parameterisations for implementation in coarse-resolution climate models.},

abstract = {A modeling paradigm is developed to augment predictive models of turbulence by effectively utilizing limited data generated from physical experiments. The key components of our approach involve inverse modeling to infer the spatial distribution of model discrepancies, and, machine learning to reconstruct discrepancy information from a large number of inverse problems into corrective model forms. We apply the methodology to turbulent flows over airfoils involving flow separation. Model augmentations are developed for the Spalart Allmaras (SA) model using adjoint-based full field inference on experimentally measured lift coefficient data. When these model forms are reconstructed using neural networks (NN) and embedded within a standard solver, we show that much improved predictions in lift can be obtained for geometries and flow conditions that were not used to train the model. The NN-augmented SA model also predicts surface pressures extremely well. Portability of this approach is demonstrated by confirming that predictive improvements are preserved when the augmentation is embedded in a different commercial finite-element solver. The broader vision is that by incorporating data that can reveal the form of the innate model discrepancy, the applicability of data-driven turbulence models can be extended to more general flows.},

@techreport{Zamanian2014,
abstract = {SummaryWithin the context of least-squares migration (LSM), we describe a methodology for using surface seismic data to infer the spatial smoothness structure of the subsurface in addition to the subsurface reflectivity model (or seismic image). In LSM (and other geophysical inverse problems), smoothness assumptions about the subsurface are commonly invoked to regularize the inversion procedure. The regularization serves to mitigate the effects of poor resolution and noise in the data and improve the quality of the inferred subsurface parameters. Viewing the problem from the perspective of Bayesian inference, a priori assumptions about the probabilistic structure of the model parameters impose this regularization. We generalize this by considering a hierarchical Bayesian formulation of the LSM problem in which parameters controlling the regularization, in addition to the reflectivity model itself, are treated as problem unknowns. Hence, rather than fixing the regularization parameters prior to inverting for the image, we allow the data to dictate where and how strongly to smooth the image. In order to construct our prior model of the subsurface and regularization parameters, we define an undirected graphical model (or Markov random field) on the subsurface model in which vertices of the graph represent reflectivity values, and edge strengths, defined on the edges of the graph, capture the degree of correlation (or lack thereof) between the vertices. Inferring the edge strengths from the data should produce an estimate of the image which preserves sharpness at the true discontinuities in the image while still allowing for smoothing of noise where appropriate. We solve the inference problem using a powerful approximation methodology known as variational Bayes, which produces marginal posterior distributions for the image and regularization parameters. Our inference framework is verified on the Marmousi model, where the hierarchical Bayesian imaging results significantly outperform standard LSM imaging.},

It is able to handle autocorrelated model errors which are very common in the application of dynamic hydrological models at catchment scales.

abstract = {We propose a sparse regression method capable of discovering the governing partial differential equation(s) of a given system by time series measurements in the spatial domain. The regression framework relies on sparsity promoting techniques to select the nonlinear and partial derivative terms terms of the governing equations that most accurately represent the data, bypassing a combinatorially large search through all possible candidate models. The method balances model complexity and regression accuracy by selecting a parsimonious model via Pareto analysis. Time series measurements can be made in an Eulerian framework where the sensors are fixed spatially, or in a Lagrangian framework where the sensors move with the dynamics. The method is computationally efficient, robust, and demonstrated to work on a variety of canonical problems of mathematical physics including Navier-Stokes, the quantum harmonic oscillator, and the diffusion equation. Moreover, the method is capable of disambiguating between potentially non-unique dynamical terms by using multiple time series taken with different initial data. Thus for a traveling wave, the method can distinguish between a linear wave equation or the Korteweg-deVries equation, for instance. The method provides a promising new technique for discovering governing equations and physical laws in parametrized spatio-temporal systems where first-principles derivations are intractable.},

To achieve sufficient spatial resolution 16.1 × 106 grid nodes were employed. Turbulent statistics along the wall bisectors show good agreement with plane channel data despite the influence of the sidewalls in the former flow. The mean secondary flow field consists of two counter-rotating cells symmetrically placed about the corner bisectors with their common flow towards each corner with strong evidence for the existence of a smaller and much weaker pair situated about the wall bisectors. The mean streamwise vorticity of each corner cell is found to be associated with a stronger vorticity distribution of the opposite sign having an absolute maximum on the nearest duct wall.},

abstract = {Introduction: Accurate and timely prediction for endemic infectious diseases is vital for public health agencies to plan and carry out any control methods at an early stage of disease outbreaks. Climatic variables has been identified as important predictors in models for infectious disease forecasts. Various approaches have been proposed in the literature to produce accurate and timely predictions and potentially improve public health response. Methods: We assessed how the machine learning LASSO method may be useful in providing useful forecasts for different pathogens in countries with different climates. Separate LASSO models were constructed for different disease/country/forecast window with different model complexity by including different sets of predictors to assess the importance of different predictors under various conditions. Results: There was a more apparent cyclicity for both climatic variables and incidence in regions further away from the equator. For most diseases, predictions made beyond 4 weeks ahead were increasingly discrepant from the actual scenario. Prediction models were more accurate in capturing the outbreak but less sensitive to predict the outbreak size. In different situations, climatic variables have different levels of importance in prediction accuracy. Conclusions: For LASSO models used for prediction, including different sets of predictors has varying effect in different situations. Short term predictions generally perform better than longer term predictions, suggesting public health agencies may need the capacity to respond at short-notice to early warnings.},

abstract = {The ability of three types of turbulence models to accurately predict the effects of curvature on the ? ow in a U-duct is studied.An explicit algebraic stress model performs slightly better than one- or two-equationlinear eddy viscosity models, although it is necessary to fully account for the variation of the production-to-dissipation-rate ratio in the algebraic stress model formulation. In their original formulations, none of these turbulence models fully captures the suppressed turbulence near the convex wall, whereas a full Reynolds stress model does. Some of the underlying assumptionsused in the development of algebraic stressmodels are investigatedandcompared with the computed ? ow? eld from the full Reynolds stress model. Through this analysis, the assumption of Reynolds stress anisotropy equilibriumused in the algebraic stress model formulation is found to be incorrect in regions of strong curvature.By the accounting for the local variationof the principal axes of the strain rate tensor, the explicit algebraic stress model correctly predicts the suppressed turbulence in the outer part of the boundary layer near the convex wall.},

@article{Lazeroms2013a,
abstract = {AbstractThis work describes the derivation of an algebraic model for the Reynolds stresses and turbulent heat flux in stably stratified turbulent flows, which are mutually coupled for this type of flow. For general two-dimensional mean flows, we present a correct way of expressing the Reynolds-stress anisotropy and the (normalized) turbulent heat flux as tensorial combinations of the mean strain rate, the mean rotation rate, the mean temperature gradient and gravity. A system of linear equations is derived for the coefficients in these expansions, which can easily be solved with computer algebra software for a specific choice of the model constants. The general model is simplified in the case of parallel mean shear flows where the temperature gradient is aligned with gravity. For this case, fully explicit and coupled expressions for the Reynolds-stress tensor and heat-flux vector are given. A self-consistent derivation of this model would, however, require finding a root of a polynomial equation of sixth-order, for which no simple analytical expression exists. Therefore, the nonlinear part of the algebraic equations is modelled through an approximation that is close to the consistent formulation. By using the framework of a {\$}K\backslashtext{\{}{\{}\backslashndash{\}}{\}} \backslashomega {\$} model (where {\$}K{\$} is turbulent kinetic energy and {\$}\backslashomega {\$} an inverse time scale) and, where needed, near-wall corrections, the model is applied to homogeneous shear flow and turbulent channel flow, both with stable stratification. For the case of homogeneous shear flow, the model predicts a critical Richardson number of 0.25 above which the turbulent kinetic energy decays to zero. The channel-flow results agree well with DNS data. Furthermore, the model is shown to be robust and approximately self-consistent. It also fulfils the requirements of realizability.},

In optical scatterometry, the least squares (LSQ) function is usually used as the objective function to quantify the difference between the calculated and measured signatures, which is based on the belief that the actual measurement errors are normally distributed with zero mean. However, in practice the normal distribution assumption of measurement errors is oversimplified since these errors come from the superimposed effect of different error sources. Biased or inaccurate results may be induced when the traditional LSQ function based Gauss-Newton (GN) method is used in optical scatterometry. In this paper, we propose a robust method based on the principle of robust estimation to deal with the abnormal distributed errors. An additional robust regression procedure is used at the end of each iteration of the GN method to obtain the more accurate parameter departure vector. Simulations and experiments have demonstrated the feasibility of our proposed method.},

In this work we study optimal control problems for a turbulent flow modeled with a Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes system. The adjoint system is obtained through the use of a Lagrangian multiplier method by setting as objective of the control a velocity matching profile or an increase or decrease in the turbulent kinetic energy. The optimality system is solved with an in-house finite element code and numerical results are reported in order to show the validity of this approach.},

abstract = {Big data has become a critically enabling component of emerging mathematical methods aimed at the automated discovery of dynamical systems, where first principles modeling may be intractable. However, in many engineering systems, abrupt changes must be rapidly characterized based on limited, incomplete, and noisy data. Many leading automated learning techniques rely on unrealistically large data sets and it is unclear how to leverage prior knowledge effectively to re-identify a model after an abrupt change. In this work, we propose a conceptual framework to recover parsimonious models of a system in response to abrupt changes in the low-data limit. First, the abrupt change is detected by comparing the estimated Lyapunov time of the data with the model prediction. Next, we apply the sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) regression to update a previously identified model with the fewest changes, either by addition, deletion, or modification of existing model terms. We demonstrate this sparse model recovery on several examples for abrupt system change detection in periodic and chaotic dynamical systems. Our examples show that sparse updates to a previously identified model perform better with less data, have lower runtime complexity, and are less sensitive to noise than identifying an entirely new model. The proposed abrupt-SINDy architecture provides a new paradigm for the rapid and efficient recovery of a system model after abrupt changes.},

abstract = {Although Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations are still the dominant tool for engineering design and analysis applications involving turbulent flows, standard RANS models are known to be unreliable in many flows of engineering relevance, including flows with separation, strong pressure gradients or mean flow curvature. With increasing amounts of 3-dimensional experimental data and high fidelity simulation data from Large Eddy Simulation (LES) and Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS), data-driven turbulence modeling has become a promising approach to increase the predictive capability of RANS simulations. Recently, a data-driven turbulence modeling approach via machine learning has been proposed to predict the Reynolds stress anisotropy of a given flow based on high fidelity data from closely related flows. In this work, the closeness of different flows is investigated to assess the prediction confidence a priori. Specifically, the Mahalanobis distance and the kernel density estimation (KDE) technique are used as metrics to quantify the distance between flow data sets in feature space. The flow over periodic hills at Re=10595 is used as the test set and seven flows with different configurations are individually used as training set. The results show that the prediction error of the Reynolds stress anisotropy is positively correlated with Mahalanobis distance and KDE distance, demonstrating that both extrapolation metrics can be used to estimate the prediction confidence a priori. A quantitative comparison using correlation coefficients shows that the Mahalanobis distance is less accurate in estimating the prediction confidence than KDE distance. The extrapolation metrics introduced in this work and the corresponding analysis provide an approach to aid in the choice of the data source and to assess the prediction confidence for data-driven turbulence modeling.},

abstract = {Sparse sensor placement is a central challenge in the efficient characterization of complex systems when the cost of acquiring and processing data is high. Leading sparse sensing methods typically exploit either spatial or temporal correlations, but rarely both. This work introduces a new sparse sensor optimization that is designed to leverage the rich spatiotemporal coherence exhibited by many systems. Our approach is inspired by the remarkable performance of flying insects, which use a few embedded strain-sensitive neurons to achieve rapid and robust flight control despite large gust disturbances. Specifically, we draw on nature to identify targeted neural-inspired sensors on a flapping wing to detect body rotation. This task is particularly challenging as the rotational twisting mode is three orders-of-magnitude smaller than the flapping modes. We show that nonlinear filtering in time, built to mimic strain-sensitive neurons, is essential to detect rotation, whereas instantaneous measurements fail. Optimized sparse sensor placement results in efficient classification with approximately ten sensors, achieving the same accuracy and noise robustness as full measurements consisting of hundreds of sensors. Sparse sensing with neural inspired encoding establishes a new paradigm in hyper-efficient, embodied sensing of spatiotemporal data and sheds light on principles of biological sensing for agile flight control.},

abstract = {The number of heuristic optimization algorithms has exploded over the last decade with new methods being proposed constantly. A recent overview of existing heuristic methods has listed over 130 algorithms. The majority of these optimization algorithms have been designed and applied to solve real-parameter function optimization problems, each claiming to be superior to other methods in terms of performance. However, most of these algorithms have been tested on relatively low dimensional problems, i.e., problems involving less than 30 parameters. With the recent emergence of Big Data, the existing optimization methods need to be tested to find those (un)suitable to handle highly dimensional problems. This paper represents an initial step in such direction. Three traditional heuristic algorithms are systematically analyzed and tested in detail for problems involving up to 100 parameters. Genetic algorithms (GA), particle swarm optimization (PSO) and differential evolution (DE) are compared in terms of accuracy and runtime, using several high dimensional standard benchmark functions.},

abstract = {Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations are widely used in engineering turbulent flow simulations. However, the mean flow fields predicted by RANS solvers could come with large discrepancies due to the uncertainties in modeled Reynolds stresses. Recently, Wang et al. demonstrated that machine learning can be used to improve the RANS modeled Reynolds stresses by leveraging data from high fidelity simulations (Physics informed machine learning approach for reconstructing Reynolds stress modeling discrepancies based on DNS data. Physical Review Fluids. 2, 034603, 2017). However, solving for mean flows from the machine-learning predicted Reynolds stresses still poses significant challenges. The present work is a critical extension of (Wang et al. 2017), and it enables the machine learning model to yield improved predictions of not only Reynolds stresses but also mean velocities therefrom. Such a development is of profound practical importance, because often the velocities and the derived quantities (e.g., drag, lift, surface friction), and not the Reynolds stresses per se, are the ultimate quantities of interest in RANS simulations. The present work has two innovations. First, we demonstrate a systematic procedure to generate mean flow features based on the integrity basis for a set of mean flow tensors, which is in contrast to the ad hoc choices features in (Wang et al. 2017). Second, we propose using machine learning to predict linear and nonlinear parts of the Reynolds stress tensor separately. Inspired by the finite polynomial representation of tensors in classical turbulence modeling, such a decomposition is instrumental in overcoming the instability of RANS equations. Several test cases are used to demonstrate the merits of the proposed approach.},

abstract = {The goal of this paper is to compare several widely used Bayesian model selection methods in practical model selection problems, highlight their differences and give recommendations about the preferred approaches. We focus on the variable subset selection for regression and classification and perform several numerical experiments using both simulated and real world data. The results show that the optimization of a utility estimate such as the cross-validation (CV) score is liable to finding overfitted models due to relatively high variance in the utility estimates when the data is scarce. This can also lead to substantial selection induced bias and optimism in the performance evaluation for the selected model. From a predictive viewpoint, best results are obtained by accounting for model uncertainty by forming the full encompassing model, such as the Bayesian model averaging solution over the candidate models. If the encompassing model is too complex, it can be robustly simplified by the projection method, in which the information of the full model is projected onto the submodels. This approach is substantially less prone to overfitting than selection based on CV-score. Overall, the projection method appears to outperform also the maximum a posteriori model and the selection of the most probable variables. The study also demonstrates that the model selection can greatly benefit from using cross-validation outside the searching process both for guiding the model size selection and assessing the predictive performance of the finally selected model.},

The spatial structure of the perturbations is determined by the proposed transport equations, and thus does not have to be inferred from full-field reference data. Depending on a small number of model parameters and the local flow conditions, a 'return to eddy viscosity' is described, and the underlying baseline state can be recovered. In order to make predictions with quantified uncertainty, we identify two separate methods, i.e. a data-free and data-driven approach. In the former no reference data is required and computationally inexpensive intervals are computed.

abstract = {Reynolds-averaged Navier--Stokes (RANS) simulations with turbulence closure models continue to play important roles in industrial flow simulations. However, the commonly used linear eddy viscosity models are intrinsically unable to handle flows with non-equilibrium turbulence. Reynolds stress models, on the other hand, are plagued by their lack of robustness. Recent studies in plane channel flows found that even substituting Reynolds stresses with errors below 0.5{\%} from direct numerical simulation (DNS) databases into RANS equations leads to velocities with large errors (up to 35{\%}). While such an observation may have only marginal relevance to traditional Reynolds stress models, it is disturbing for the recently emerging data-driven models that treat the Reynolds stress as an explicit source term in the RANS equations, as it suggests that the RANS equations with such models can be ill-conditioned. So far, a rigorous analysis of the condition of such models is still lacking. As such, in this work we propose a metric based on local condition number function for a priori evaluation of the conditioning of the RANS equations. We further show that the ill-conditioning cannot be explained by the global matrix condition number of the discretized RANS equations. Comprehensive numerical tests are performed on turbulent channel flows at various Reynolds numbers and additionally on two complex flows, i.e., flow over periodic hills and flow in a square duct. Results suggest that the proposed metric can adequately explain observations in previous studies, i.e., deteriorated model conditioning with increasing Reynolds number and better conditioning of the implicit treatment of Reynolds stress compared to the explicit treatment. This metric can play critical roles in the future development of data-driven turbulence models by enforcing the conditioning as a requirement on these models.},

abstract = {High-resolution large-eddy simulation is used to investigate the mean and turbulence properties of a separated flow in a channel constricted by periodically distributed hill-shaped protrusions on one wall that obstruct the channel by 33{\%} of its height and are arranged 9 hill heights apart. The geometry is a modification of an experimental configuration, the adaptation providing an extended region of post-reattachment recovery and allowing high-quality simulations to be performed at acceptable computing costs. The Reynolds number, based on the hill height and the bulk velocity above the crest is 10595. The simulated domain is streamwise as well as spanwise periodic, extending from one hill crest to the next in the streamwise direction and over 4.5 hill heights in the spanwise direction. This arrangement minimizes uncertainties associated with boundary conditions and makes the flow an especially attractive generic test case for validating turbulence closures for statistically two-dimensional separation. The emphasis of the study is on elucidating the turbulence mechanisms associated with separation, recirculation reattachment, acceleration and wall proximity. Hence, careful attention has been paid to resolution, and a body-fitted, low-aspect-ratio, nearly orthogonal numerical grid of close to 5 million nodes has been used. Unusually, the results of two entirely independent simulations with different codes for identical flow and numerical conditions are compared and shown to agree closely. Results are included for mean velocity, Reynolds stresses, anisotropy measures, spectra and budgets for the Reynolds stresses. Moreover, an analysis of structural characteristics is undertaken on the basis of instantaneous realizations, and links to features observed in the statistical results are identified and interpreted. Among a number of interesting features, a distinct ‘splatting' of eddies on the windward hill side following reattachment is observed, which generates strong spanwise fluctuations that are reflected, statistically, by the spanwise normal stress near the wall exceeding that of the streamwise stress by a substantial margin, despite the absence of spanwise strain.},

abstract = {Extracting governing equations from dynamic data is an essential task in model selection and parameter estimation. The form of the governing equation is rarely known a priori; however, based on the sparsity-of-effect principle one may assume that the number of candidate functions needed to represent the dynamics is very small. In this work, we leverage the sparse structure of the governing equations along with recent results from random sampling theory to develop methods for selecting dynamical systems from under-sampled data. In particular, we detail three sampling strategies that lead to the exact recovery of first-order dynamical systems when we are given fewer samples than unknowns. The first method makes no assumptions on the behavior of the data, and requires a certain number of random initial samples. The second method utilizes the structure of the governing equation to limit the number of random initializations needed. The third method leverages chaotic behavior in the data to construct a nearly deterministic sampling strategy. Using results from compressive sensing, we show that the strategies lead to exact recovery, which is stable to the sparse structure of the governing equations and robust to noise in the estimation of the velocity. Computational results validate each of the sampling strategies and highlight potential applications.},

abstract = {Computational fluid dynamics in conjunction with the Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes approach is nowadays routinely employed in a large variety of engineering and$\backslash$r$\backslash$nindustrial applications despite some well-known reliability issues in more complex flows. In this study, the performance of a state-of-the-art Explicit-Algebraic-Stress$\backslash$r$\backslash$nModel (EASM) and a promising elliptic-blending approach is assessed on a range of test cases to predict complex turbulent flows. In an attempt to improve the quality of the predictions, near-wall-anisotropy modifications are introduced to the EASM, which provide better predictions for the Reynolds-stress and anisotropy tensor close to solid walls. In addition, a novel elliptic-blending RANS model is presented, which is based on the inverse turbulence time scale w, and which is equipped with a non-linear constitutive stress-strain relationship. The coefficients of the non-linear stress-strain relationship are obtained from the explicit solution of a Second-Moment Closure in the limit of weak equilibrium, and by imposing an internal consistency constraint and near-wall-anisotropy modifications, such that the highly anisotropic state of turbulence and the limiting two-component state is correctly reproduced at solid boundaries. The performance of the modified EASM and the novel elliptic-blending model are illustrated and assessed for a range of complex turbulent flows. It is expected that, due to ever increasing computational resources, unified or hybrid RANS/LES approaches will slowly penetrate into engineering applications where improved accuracy and reliability is needed. For this reason, a unified RANS/LES/DNS framework is presented, which is expected to provide the required amount of turbulence modelling for any mesh resolution and seamlessly operates between RANS and DNS mode. This is achieved by a revised Flow Simulation Methodology where the turbulence modelling contribution of a RANS model is rescaled using a damping function. The Flow Simulation Methodology is operating in conjunction with a newly developed damping function and a tailored convection discretisation scheme. In addition, a thorough calibration study is performed, which ensures proper turbulence resolving capabilities. It is conjectured that a sophisticated RANS model will also improve the overall quality of the predictions of any hybrid RANS/LES model. For this reason, the new elliptic-blending RANS model is incorporated, together with two successively simpler turbulence models, into the unified RANS/LES/DNS framework and the performance are assessed on a range of test cases, and compared to other widely used hybrid RANS/LES methods.},

abstract = {One of the greater issues in Genetic Programming (GP) is the computational effort required to run the evolution and discover a good solution. Phenomena such as program bloating (where genetic programs rapidly grow in size) can quickly exhaust available memory resources and slow down the evolutionary process, while the heavy cost of performing fitness evaluation can make problems which have a lot of available data very slow to solve. These issues may limit GP in some tasks it can appropriately be applied to, as well as inhibit its applications in time/space sensitive environments. In this thesis, we look at developing solutions to some of these issues in GP computational cost. First, we develop an algebraic program simplification method based on simple rules and hashing techniques, and use this method in conjunction with the standard GP on a variety of tasks. Our results suggest that program simplification can lead to a significant reduction in program size, while not significantly changing the effectiveness of the systems in finding solution programs. Secondly, we analyse the effects of program simplification on the internal GP "building blocks" to investigate whether simplification is a destructive or constructive force. Using two models for building blocks (numerical-nodes and the more complex fixed-depth subtree), we track building blocks through GP runs on a symbolic regression problem, both with and without using simplification. We find that the program simplification process can both disrupt and construct building blocks in the GP populations. However, GP systems using simplification appear to retain important building blocks, and the simplification process appears to lead to an increase in genetic diversity. These may help explain why using simplification does not reduce the effectiveness of GP systems in solving tasks. Lastly, we develop two methods of reducing the cost of fitness evaluation by reducing the number of node evaluations performed. The first method is elitism avoidance, which avoids re-evaluating programs which have been placed in the population using elitismreproduction. Thismethod reduces the CPU time for evolving solutions for six different GP tasks. The second method is a subtree caching mechanism which store fitness evaluations for subtrees in a cache so that they may be fetched when these subtrees are encountered in future fitness evaluations. Results suggest that using this mechanism can significantly reduce both the number of node evaluations and the overall CPU time used in evolving solutions, without reducing the fitness of the solutions produced.},

Gradient-Enhanced Kriging is a response surface technique that can be used for uncertainty quantification. Aggressive Space-Mapping is applied to three academic fluid-structure inter- action problems of increasing complexity. For most test cases considered the esti- mated and observed speedup with respect to the Quasi-Newton algorithm is larger than 1. The influence of the timestep size on the speedup is large compared to other parameters. In case of compressible flows the speedup can rise to 1.5 for large time-steps. In case of incompressible flows higher speedups can be expected due to strong coupling of the fluid-structure interaction. Gradient-Enhanced Kriging (GEK) is applied to two academic uncertainty quan- tification problems of increasing complexity. The observed speedup of GEK with respect to Kriging increases with the number of dimensions of the design-space. When the gradients are computed with the adjoint method the theoretical speedup theor ?(1+??), where ?? is the number of dimensions. The observed speedup and is ?? = ? etical speedup are only close if the derivative noise, variation of the sampling plan and the variation of the target accuracies are taken into account.},

abstract = {While there is currently a lot of enthusiasm about "big data", useful data is usually "small" and expensive to acquire. In this paper, we present a new paradigm of learning partial differential equations from {\{}$\backslash$em small{\}} data. In particular, we introduce $\backslash$emph{\{}hidden physics models{\}}, which are essentially data-efficient learning machines capable of leveraging the underlying laws of physics, expressed by time dependent and nonlinear partial differential equations, to extract patterns from high-dimensional data generated from experiments. The proposed methodology may be applied to the problem of learning, system identification, or data-driven discovery of partial differential equations. Our framework relies on Gaussian processes, a powerful tool for probabilistic inference over functions, that enables us to strike a balance between model complexity and data fitting. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated through a variety of canonical problems, spanning a number of scientific domains, including the Navier-Stokes, Schr$\backslash$"odinger, Kuramoto-Sivashinsky, and time dependent linear fractional equations. The methodology provides a promising new direction for harnessing the long-standing developments of classical methods in applied mathematics and mathematical physics to design learning machines with the ability to operate in complex domains without requiring large quantities of data.},

The control variate is obtained starting from the solution of an auxiliary problem with smoothed permeability coefficient and its expected value is effectively computed with a Stochastic Collocation method on the finest level in which the control variate is applied. We analyze the variance reduction induced by the control variate, and the total mean square error of the new estimator. To conclude we present some numerical examples and a comparison with the standard MLMC method, which shows the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

abstract = {This article focuses on the formulation, validation and application of the continuous adjoint method for turbulent flows in aero/hydrodynamic optimization. Though discrete adjoint has been extensively used in the past to compute objective function gradients with respect to (w.r.t.) the design variables under turbulent flow conditions, the development of the continuous adjoint variant for these flows is not widespread in the literature, hindering, to an extend, the computation of exact sensitivity derivatives. The article initially presents a general formulation of the continuous adjoint method for incompressible flows, under the commonly used assumption of “frozen turbulence”. Then, the necessary addenda are presented in order to deal with the differentiation of both low- and high-Reynolds (with wall functions) number turbulence models; the latter requires the introduction of the so-called “adjoint wall functions”. An approach to dealing with distance variations is also presented. The developed methods are initially validated in {\$}{\$}2D{\$}{\$} 2 D cases and then applied to industrial shape and topology optimization problems, originating from the automotive and hydraulic turbomachinery industries.},

abstract = {This paper proposes a new approach for the study of complex turbulent flows of aeronautics that integrates experimental fluid dynamics (EFD), employing methods such as wind tunnel experiments, and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) by using a data assimilation technique. The approach aims at representing complex turbulent flows more properly than conventional EFD and CFD approaches by estimating the proper angle of attack, the proper Mach number, and the proper turbulent viscosity, which are the three uncertainty factors in EFD and CFD. To this end, the ensemble transform Kalman filter (ETKF), a sequential advanced data assimilation method, is employed for the estimation and applied to transonic flows around the RAE 2822 airfoil (two-dimensional flow) and transonic flows around the ONERA M6 wing (three-dimensional flow). The results computed using the angles of attack, Mach numbers, and turbulent viscosities estimated by the ETKF diminish the discrepancies between the results of standard computations and experiments. These findings show the effectiveness of this approach, which combines EFD and CFD using data assimilation to represent complex turbulent flows.},

These nonlinear equations have often been compared to experimental data through the outputs of numerical models. Here we perform a priori analysis of nonlinear eddy-viscosity models using direct numerical simulation (DNS) of simple shear flows. In this paper, the constitutive equation is directly checked using a tensor projection which involves several invariants of the flow. This provides a 3 terms development which is exact for 2D flows, and a best approximation for 3D flows. We provide the quadratic nonlinear constitutive equation for the near-wall region of simple shear flows using DNS data, and estimate their coefficients. We show that these coefficients have several common properties for the different simple shear flow databases considered. We also show that in the central region of pipe flows, where the shear rate is very small, the coefficients of the constitutive equation diverge, indicating the failure of this representation for vanishing shears. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Linear Least Squares (LLS) problems are particularly difficult to solve because they are frequently ill-conditioned, and involve large quantities of data. Ill-conditioned LLS problems are commonly seen in mathematics and geosciences, where regularization algorithms are employed to seek optimal solutions. For many problems, even with the use of regularization algorithms it may be impossible to obtain an accurate solution. Riley and Golub suggested an iterative scheme for solving LLS problems. For the early iteration algorithm, it is difficult to improve the well-conditioned perturbed matrix and accelerate the convergence at the same time. Aiming at this problem, self-adaptive iteration algorithm (SAIA) is proposed in this paper for solving severe ill-conditioned LLS problems. The algorithm is different from other popular algorithms proposed in recent references. It avoids matrix inverse by using Cholesky decomposition, and tunes the perturbation parameter according to the rate of residual error decline in the iterative process. Example shows that the algorithm can greatly reduce iteration times, accelerate the convergence, and also greatly enhance the computation accuracy.},

The migration has largely been driven by both the success of Reynolds-averaged methods over a wide variety of flows and the inherent limitations of the method itself. Practitioners, emboldened by their ability to predict a wide variety of statistically steady equilibrium turbulent flows, have now turned their attention to flow control and non-equilibrium flows, i.e. separation control.

abstract = {Computational fluid dynamics in conjunction with the Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes approach is nowadays routinely employed in a large variety of engineering and$\backslash$r$\backslash$nindustrial applications despite some well-known reliability issues in more complex flows. In this study, the performance of a state-of-the-art Explicit-Algebraic-Stress$\backslash$r$\backslash$nModel (EASM) and a promising elliptic-blending approach is assessed on a range of test cases to predict complex turbulent flows. In an attempt to improve the quality of the predictions, near-wall-anisotropy modifications are introduced to the EASM, which provide better predictions for the Reynolds-stress and anisotropy tensor close to solid walls. In addition, a novel elliptic-blending RANS model is presented, which is based on the inverse turbulence time scale w, and which is equipped with a non-linear constitutive stress-strain relationship. The coefficients of the non-linear stress-strain relationship are obtained from the explicit solution of a Second-Moment Closure in the limit of weak equilibrium, and by imposing an internal consistency constraint and near-wall-anisotropy modifications, such that the highly anisotropic state of turbulence and the limiting two-component state is correctly reproduced at solid boundaries. The performance of the modified EASM and the novel elliptic-blending model are illustrated and assessed for a range of complex turbulent flows. It is expected that, due to ever increasing computational resources, unified or hybrid RANS/LES approaches will slowly penetrate into engineering applications where improved accuracy and reliability is needed. For this reason, a unified RANS/LES/DNS framework is presented, which is expected to provide the required amount of turbulence modelling for any mesh resolution and seamlessly operates between RANS and DNS mode. This is achieved by a revised Flow Simulation Methodology where the turbulence modelling contribution of a RANS model is rescaled using a damping function. The Flow Simulation Methodology is operating in conjunction with a newly developed damping function and a tailored convection discretisation scheme. In addition, a thorough calibration study is performed, which ensures proper turbulence resolving capabilities. It is conjectured that a sophisticated RANS model will also improve the overall quality of the predictions of any hybrid RANS/LES model. For this reason, the new elliptic-blending RANS model is incorporated, together with two successively simpler turbulence models, into the unified RANS/LES/DNS framework and the performance are assessed on a range of test cases, and compared to other widely used hybrid RANS/LES methods.},

This class of methods, which can be viewed as an ex- tension of the classical gradient algorithm, is attractive due to its simplicity and thus is adequate for solving large-scale problems even with dense matrix data. However, such methods are also known to converge quite slowly. In this paper we present a new fast iterative shrinkage-thresholding algorithm (FISTA) which preserves the computational simplicity of ISTA but with a global rate of convergence which is proven to be significantly better, both theoretically and practically. Initial promising nu- merical results for wavelet-based image deblurring demonstrate the capabilities of FISTA which is shown to be faster than ISTA by several orders of magnitude. Key},

abstract = {Predictive simulation of many complex flows requires moving beyond Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) based models to representations resolving at least some scales of turbulence in at least some regions of the flow. To resolve turbulence where necessary while avoiding the cost of performing large eddy simulation (LES) everywhere, a broad range of hybrid RANS/LES methods have been developed. While successful in some situations, existing methods exhibit a number of deficiencies which limit their predictive capability in many cases of interest, for instance in many flows involving smooth wall separation. These deficiencies result from inappropriate blending approaches and resulting inconsistencies between the resolved and modeled turbulence as well as errors inherited from the underlying RANS and LES models. This work details these problems and their effects in hybrid simulations, and develops a modeling paradigm aimed at overcoming these challenges. The new approach discards typical blending approaches in favor of a hybridization strategy in which the RANS and LES model components act through separate models formulated using the mean and fluctuating velocity, respectively. Further, a forcing approach in which fluctuating content is actively transferred from the modeled to the resolved scales is introduced. Finally, the model makes use of an anisotropic LES model that is intended to represent the effects of grid anisotropy. The model is demonstrated on fully-developed, incompressible channel flow and shown to be very promising.},

abstract = {This paper presents a novel and promising approach to turbulence model formulation, rather than putting forward a particular new model. Evolutionary computation has brought symbolic regression of scalar fields into the domain of algorithms and this paper describes a novel expansion of Gene Expression Programming for the purpose of tensor modeling. By utilizing high-fidelity data and uncertainty measures, mathematical models for tensors are created. The philosophy behind the framework is to give freedom to the algorithm to produce a constraint-free model; its own functional form that was not previously imposed. Turbulence modeling is the target application, specifically the improvement of separated flow prediction. Models are created by considering the anisotropy of the turbulent stress tensor and formulating non-linear constitutive stress–strain relationships. A previously unseen flow field is computed and compared to the baseline linear model and an established non-linear model of comparable complexity. The results are highly encouraging.},

abstract = {A Bayesian uncertainty quantification approach is developed and applied to RANS turbulence models of fully-developed channel flow. The approach aims to capture uncertainty due to both uncertain parameters and model inadequacy. Parameter uncertainty is represented by treating the parameters of the turbulence model as random variables. To capture model uncertainty, four stochastic extensions of four eddy viscosity turbulence models are developed. The sixteen coupled models are calibrated using DNS data according to Bayes' theorem, producing posterior probability density functions. In addition, the competing models are compared in terms of two items: posterior plausibility and predictions of a quantity of interest. The posterior plausibility indicates which model is preferred by the data according to Bayes' theorem, while the predictions allow assessment of how strongly the model differences impact the quantity of interest. Results for the channel flow case show that both the stochastic model and the turbulence model affect the predicted quantity of interest. The posterior plausibility favors an inhomogeneous stochastic model coupled with the Chien k-? model. After calibration with data at Re$\tau$ = 944 and Re$\tau$ = 2003, this model gives a prediction of the centerline velocity at Re$\tau$ = 5000 with uncertainty of approximately ±4{\%}.},

The chromosomes encode expression trees which are the object of selection. The creation of these separate entities (genome and expression tree) with distinct functions allows the algorithm to perform with high efficiency that greatly surpasses existing adaptive techniques.

For spatially localized changes in the velocity, or for changes in the source location, the travel-time perturbation may be different for different scattering paths. The coda waves that arrive within a certain time window are therefore subject to a distribution of travel-time perturbations. Here I present the general theory of coda wave interferometry, and show how the time-shifted correlation coefficient can be used to estimate the mean and variance of the distribution of travel-time perturbations. I show how this general theory can be used to estimate changes in the wave velocity, in the location of scatterer positions, and in the source location.},

In this work, we propose a shallow neural network-based learning methodology for such fluid flow reconstruction. Our approach learns an end-to-end mapping between the sensor measurements and the high-dimensional fluid flow field, without any heavy preprocessing on the raw data. No prior knowledge is assumed to be available, and the estimation method is purely data-driven. We demonstrate the performance on three examples in fluid mechanics and oceanography, showing that this modern data-driven approach outperforms traditional modal approximation techniques which are commonly used for flow reconstruction. Not only does the proposed method show superior performance characteristics, it can also produce a comparable level of performance with traditional methods in the area, using significantly fewer sensors. Thus, the mathematical architecture is ideal for emerging global monitoring technologies where measurement data are often limited.},

Feature selection is especially difficult and computationally intensive when the number of variables approaches or exceeds the number of samples, as is often the case for many genomic datasets. Here, we introduce a new approach -- the Bayesian Ising Approximation (BIA) -- to rapidly calculate posterior probabilities for feature relevance in L2 penalized linear regression. In the regime where the regression problem is strongly regularized by the prior, we show that computing the marginal posterior probabilities for features is equivalent to computing the magnetizations of an Ising model. Using a mean field approximation, we show it is possible to rapidly compute the feature selection path described by the posterior probabilities as a function of the L2 penalty. We present simulations and analytical results illustrating the accuracy of the BIA on some simple regression problems. Finally, we demonstrate the applicability of the BIA to high dimensional regression by analyzing a gene expression dataset with nearly 30,000 features.},

abstract = {While there is currently a lot of enthusiasm about “big data” useful data is usually “small” and expensive to acquire. In this paper, we present a new paradigm of learning partial differential equations from small data. In particular, we introduce hidden physics models, which are essentially data-efficient learning machines capable of leveraging the underlying laws of physics, expressed by time dependent and nonlinear partial differential equations, to extract patterns from high-dimensional data generated from experiments. The proposed methodology may be applied to the problem of learning, system identification, or data-driven discovery of partial differential equations. Our framework relies on Gaussian processes, a powerful tool for probabilistic inference over functions, that enables us to strike a balance between model complexity and data fitting. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated through a variety of canonical problems, spanning a number of scientific domains, including the Navier–Stokes, Schr{\"{o}}dinger, Kuramoto–Sivashinsky, and time dependent linear fractional equations. The methodology provides a promising new direction for harnessing the long-standing developments of classical methods in applied mathematics and mathematical physics to design learning machines with the ability to operate in complex domains without requiring large quantities of data.},

abstract = {We propose a sparse regression method capable of discovering the governing partial differential equation(s) of a given system by time series measurements in the spatial domain. The regression framework relies on sparsity promoting techniques to select the nonlinear and partial derivative terms terms of the governing equations that most accurately represent the data, bypassing a combinatorially large search through all possible candidate models. The method balances model complexity and regression accuracy by selecting a parsimonious model via Pareto analysis. Time series measurements can be made in an Eulerian framework where the sensors are fixed spatially, or in a Lagrangian framework where the sensors move with the dynamics. The method is computationally efficient, robust, and demonstrated to work on a variety of canonical problems of mathematical physics including Navier-Stokes, the quantum harmonic oscillator, and the diffusion equation. Moreover, the method is capable of disambiguating between potentially non-unique dynamical terms by using multiple time series taken with different initial data. Thus for a traveling wave, the method can distinguish between a linear wave equation or the Korteweg-deVries equation, for instance. The method provides a promising new technique for discovering governing equations and physical laws in parametrized spatio-temporal systems where first-principles derivations are intractable.},

abstract = {This report describes the work carried out in `universality' aspects of the dynamics of turbulence in compressible flows. Direct numerical simulations (DNSs) are carried out in different inhomogeneous and anisotropic flows. All discussed flows show regions of strong imbalance of turbulent production and turbulent dissipation. This distinguishes this work from most studies in the literature about the fundamentals of turbulent dynamics. A characteristic decomposition in addition to temporal and spatial filtering are applied as tools to compare differences in the turbulent dynamics across different flow topologies. The work includes a discussion about universal aspects of the velocity gradient and related quantities in a turbulent boundary layer, in a jet flow as well as in a wake flow. Invariant features are highlighted and quantified and the differences are pointed out. The velocity gradient and the enstrophy production, as one of the key quantities in the turbulent energy cascading process, are discussed in great detail in the turbulent boundary layer flow. Focus hereby is on the wall-normal development of the structure of the enstrophy production. This is followed by a comprehensive overview of a turbulent boundary layer. This includes the presentation and discussion of global energy redistributing mechanisms from different perspectives. The key role of turbulence in these processes is made clear. The energy cascade is dissected at different locations which reveals three different transfer processes. Two of which are transferring energy from larger scales of motion towards smaller scales of motion. In addition a backscatter mechanism was discovered that transfers energy from smaller scales towards larger scales of motion. Besides this some specific and potentially universal features of turbulence within the turbulent boundary layer results are discussed.},

Existing models for the pressure-strain and dissipation terms have been analyzed using a priori calculations. All pressure-strain models are incorrect in the high- strain region near separation, although a bettermatch is observed downstream, well into the separated-flow region. Near-wall inhomogeneity causes pressure-strain models to predict incorrect signs for the normal components close to the wall. In a posteriori computations, full Reynolds stress and explicit algebraic Reynolds stress models predict the separation point with varying degrees of success. However, as with one- and two-equation models, the separation bubble size is invariably over-predicted.},

abstract = {Turbulence modeling is a critical component in numerical simulations of industrial flows based on Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations. However, after decades of efforts in the turbulence modeling community, universally applicable RANS models with predictive capabilities are still lacking. Recently, data-driven methods have been proposed as a promising alternative to the traditional approaches of turbulence model development. In this work we propose a data-driven, physics-informed machine learning approach for predicting discrepancies in RANS modeled Reynolds stresses. The discrepancies are formulated as functions of the mean flow features. By using a modern machine learning technique based on random forests, the discrepancy functions are first trained with benchmark flow data and then used to predict Reynolds stresses discrepancies in new flows. The method is used to predict the Reynolds stresses in the flow over periodic hills by using two training flow scenarios of increasing difficulties: (1) the flow in the same periodic hills geometry yet at a lower Reynolds number, and (2) the flow in a different hill geometry with a similar recirculation zone. Excellent predictive performances were observed in both scenarios, demonstrating the merits of the proposed method. Improvement of RANS modeled Reynolds stresses enabled by the proposed method is an important step towards predictive turbulence modeling, where the ultimate goal is to predict the quantities of interest (e.g., velocity field, drag, lift) more accurately by solving RANS equations with the Reynolds stresses obtained therefrom.},

abstract = {An array of co-rotating vortex generators (VG) is placed in a supersonic boundary layer, similar to that on an airlinerwing.Direct numerical simulations (DNS) are conducted, with unsteady turbulent content in the incoming boundary layer obtained fromthe synthetic- turbulence approach of Shur et al. (Flow Turbul. Combust. 93, 63–92, 2014). The RANS models are tested in two ways: with a straightforward application to the problem, but also by solving the turbulence equations in the “frozen” average flowfield of theDNS and there- fore in “passive”mode,which appears to be a powerful procedure, similar to that of Parneix et al. (J. Fluids Eng. 120(1), 40–47, 1998). Side-by-side comparisons become clearer. The model Reynolds stresses are compared with the Reynolds stresses of the DNS. A plausible definition of an effective scalar eddy viscosity extracted fromthe DNS is also used for com- parison, providing a target value. The models are the k-$\omega$ Shear Stress Transport model of Menter (1993) (SST) and the curvature-corrected version of Smirnov andMenter (J. Turbo- mach. 131(4), 041010, 2009)whichwewill denote by SST-RC, the eddy-viscosity transport model of Spalart and Allmaras (1992) (SA), and the SA modelwith Rotation and Curvature correction of Spalart and Shur (Aerosp. Sci. Technol. 1(5), 297–302, 1997) (SARC). As expected, SST and especially SA return an excessive decay of the peak vorticity, and both SST-RC and SARC perform better, but the flow is too complex for RANS to near perfec- tion. This decay is very detrimental in practice, since their persistence is the key property of vortices used for separation control. ?},

The feature search involved in the proposed method is composed of two main steps: feature composition and feature subset selection. EFS adopts a bottom-up feature composition strategy that eliminates the need for a symbolic representation of the features and exploits the variable selection process involved in pathwise regularized linear regression to perform the feature subset selection step. The result is a regression method that is competitive against neural networks, and outperforms both linear methods and Multiple Regression Genetic Programming, up to now the best regression tool based on evolutionary computation.},

abstract = {The data-driven adaptive algorithms are explored as a means of increasing the accuracy of Reynolds-averaged turbulence models. This dissertation presents two new data-driven adaptive computational models for simulating turbulent flow, where partial-but-incomplete measurement data is available. These models automatically adjust (i.e., adapts) the closure coefficients of the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) k -$\omega$ turbulence equations to improve agreement between the simulated flow and a set of prescribed measurement data. The first approach is the data-driven adaptive RANS k -$\omega$ (D-DARK) model. It is validated with three canonical flow geometries: pipe flow, the backward-facing step, and flow around an airfoil. For all 3 test cases, the D-DARK model improves agreement with experimental data in comparison to the results from a non-adaptive RANS k -$\omega$ model that uses standard values of the closure coefficients. The second approach is the Retrospective Cost Adaptation (RCA) k -$\omega$ model. The key enabling technology is that of retrospective cost adaptation, which was devel- oped for real-time adaptive control technology, but is used in this work for data-driven model adaptation. The algorithm conducts an optimization, which seeks to minimize the surrogate performance, and by extension the real flow-field error. The advantage of the RCA approach over the D-DARK approach is that it is capable of adapting to unsteady measurements. The RCA-RANS k -$\omega$ model is verified with a statistically steady test case (pipe flow) as well as two unsteady test cases: vortex shedding from a surface-mounted cube and flow around a square cylinder. The RCA-RANS k -$\omega$ model effectively adapts to both averaged steady and unsteady measurement data.},

This problem is made more difficult by the fact that many systems of interest exhibit diverse behaviors across multiple time scales. We introduce a number of data-driven strategies for discovering nonlinear multiscale dynamical systems and their embeddings from data. We consider two canonical cases: (i) systems for which we have full measurements of the governing variables, and (ii) systems for which we have incomplete measurements. For systems with full state measurements, we show that the recent sparse identification of nonlinear dynamical systems (SINDy) method can discover governing equations with relatively little data and introduce a sampling method that allows SINDy to scale efficiently to problems with multiple time scales. Specifically, we can discover distinct governing equations at slow and fast scales. For systems with incomplete observations, we show that the Hankel alternative view of Koopman (HAVOK) method, based on time-delay embedding coordinates, can be used to obtain a linear model and Koopman invariant measurement system that nearly perfectly captures the dynamics of nonlinear quasiperiodic systems. We introduce two strategies for using HAVOK on systems with multiple time scales. Together, our approaches provide a suite of mathematical strategies for reducing the data required to discover and model nonlinear multiscale systems.},

abstract = {The ability of non-linear eddy-viscosity and second-moment models to predict separation from two- and three-dimensional curved surfaces is examined on the basis of computations for two flows that are geometrically akin: one separating from periodically-spaced, two-dimensional 'hills' in a plane channel, and the other from a three-dimensional hill in a duct. One major objective is to examine whether the predictive performance in 3-d (three-dimensional) conditions relates to that in 2-d (two-dimensional) flow. In the former, the separation pattern is far more complicated, being characterised by multiple vortical structures associated with 'open' separation. The predicted separation behaviour in the 2-d flow differs significantly from model to model, with only one non-linear model among those examined performing well, this variant formulated to adhere to the two-component wall limit. In 3-d separation, none of the models gives a credible representation of the complex multi-vortical separation pattern. ?? 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) was introduced by Evensen in 1994 (Evensen 1994 J. Geophys. Res. 99 10143–62) as a novel method for data assimilation: state estimation for noisily observed time-dependent problems. Since that time it has had enormous impact in many application domains because of its robustness and ease of implementation, and numerical evidence of its accuracy. In this paper we propose the application of an iterative ensemble Kalman method for the solution of a wide class of inverse problems. In this context we show that the estimate of the unknown function that we obtain with the ensemble Kalman method lies in a subspace A spanned by the initial ensemble. Hence the resulting error may be bounded above by the error found from the best approximation in this subspace. We provide numerical experiments which compare the error incurred by the ensemble Kalman method for inverse problems with the error of the best approximation in A, and with variants on traditional least-squares approaches, restricted to the subspace A. In so doing we demonstrate that the ensemble Kalman method for inverse problems provides a derivative-free optimization method with comparable accuracy to that achieved by traditional least-squares approaches. Furthermore, we also demonstrate that the accuracy is of the same order of magnitude as that achieved by the best approximation. Three examples are used to demonstrate these assertions: inversion of a compact linear operator; inversion of piezometric head to determine hydraulic conductivity in a Darcy model of groundwater flow; and inversion of Eulerian velocity measurements at positive times to determine the initial condition in an incompressible fluid.

abstract = {Supervised machine learning models boast remarkable predictive capabilities. But can you trust your model? Will it work in deployment? What else can it tell you about the world? We want models to be not only good, but interpretable. And yet the task of interpretation appears underspecified. Papers provide diverse and sometimes non-overlapping motivations for interpretability, and offer myriad notions of what attributes render models interpretable. Despite this ambiguity, many papers proclaim interpretability axiomatically, absent further explanation. In this paper, we seek to refine the discourse on interpretability. First, we examine the motivations underlying interest in interpretability, finding them to be diverse and occasionally discordant. Then, we address model properties and techniques thought to confer interpretability, identifying transparency to humans and post-hoc explanations as competing notions. Throughout, we discuss the feasibility and desirability of different notions, and question the oft-made assertions that linear models are interpretable and that deep neural networks are not.},

abstract = {The turbulence closure model is the dominant source of error in most Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes simulations, yet no reliable estimators for this error component currently exist. Here we develop a stochastic, a posteriori error estimate, calibrated to specific classes of flow. It is based on variability in model closure coefficients across multiple flow scenarios, for multiple closure models. The variability is estimated using Bayesian calibration against experimental data for each scenario, and Bayesian Model-Scenario Averaging (BMSA) is used to collate the resulting posteriors, to obtain a stochastic estimate of a Quantity of Interest (QoI) in an unmeasured (prediction) scenario. The scenario probabilities in BMSA are chosen using a sensor which automatically weights those scenarios in the calibration set which are similar to the prediction scenario. The methodology is applied to the class of turbulent boundary-layers subject to various pressure gradients. For all considered prediction scenarios the standard-deviation of the stochastic estimate is consistent with the measurement ground truth. Furthermore, the mean of the estimate is more consistently accurate than the individual model predictions. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {The ability to discover physical laws and governing equations from data is one of humankind's greatest intellectual achievements. A quantitative understanding of dynamic constraints and balances in nature has facilitated rapid development of knowledge and enabled advanced technological achievements, including aircraft, combustion engines, satellites, and electrical power. In this work, we combine sparsity-promoting techniques and machine learning with nonlinear dynamical systems to discover governing physical equations from measurement data. The only assumption about the structure of the model is that there are only a few important terms that govern the dynamics, so that the equations are sparse in the space of possible functions; this assumption holds for many physical systems. In particular, we use sparse regression to determine the fewest terms in the dynamic governing equations required to accurately represent the data. The resulting models are parsimonious, balancing model complexity with descriptive ability while avoiding overfitting. We demonstrate the algorithm on a wide range of problems, from simple canonical systems, including linear and nonlinear oscillators and the chaotic Lorenz system, to the fluid vortex shedding behind an obstacle. The fluid example illustrates the ability of this method to discover the underlying dynamics of a system that took experts in the community nearly 30 years to resolve. We also show that this method generalizes to parameterized, time-varying, or externally forced systems.},

This latter model, being trained, encapsulates the information about the model error localized for different hydrological conditions in the past and is used to estimate the probability distribution of the model error for the new hydrological model runs. The M5 model tree is used as a machine learning model. The method is tested to estimate uncertainty of a conceptual rainfall runoff model of the Bagmati catchment in Nepal.

It is argued that RANS will further play an important role, especially in industrial and environmental computations, and that the further increase in the computing power will be used more to utilize advanced RANS models to shorten the design and marketing cycle rather than to yield the way to LES. We also discuss some current and future developments in RANS aimed at improving their performance and range of applicability, as well as their potential in hybrid approaches in combination with the LES strategy. Limitations in LES at high Reynolds (Re) and Rayleigh (Ra) number flows and heat transfer are revisited and some hybrid RANS/LES routes are discussed. The potential of very large eddy simulations (VLES) of flows dominated by (pseudo)-deterministic eddy structures, based on transient RANS (T-RANS) and similar approaches, is discussed and illustrated in an example of "ultra-hard" (very high Ra) thermal convection.},

abstract = {In this paper, we apply Bayesian uncertainty quantification techniques to the processes of calibrating complex mathematical models and predicting quantities of interest (QoI's) with such models. These techniques also enable the systematic comparison of competing model classes. The processes of calibration and comparison constitute the building blocks of a larger validation process, the goal of which is to accept or reject a given mathematical model for the prediction of a particular QoI for a particular scenario. In this work, we take the first step in this process by applying the methodology to the analysis of the SpalartAllmaras turbulence model in the context of incompressible, boundary layer flows. Three competing model classes based on the SpalartAllmaras model are formulated, calibrated against experimental data, and used to issue a prediction with quantified uncertainty. The model classes are compared in terms of their posterior probabilities and their prediction of QoI's. The model posterior probability represents the relative plausibility of a model class given the data. Thus, it incorporates the model's ability to fit experimental observations. Alternatively, comparing models using the predicted QoI connects the process to the needs of decision makers that use the results of the model. We show that by using both the model plausibility and predicted QoI, one has the opportunity to reject some model classes after calibration, before subjecting the remaining classes to additional validation challenges. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

To optimise the use of the marine areas, wind farms are typically clustered in units of several hundred turbines. Understanding wakes of wind farms, which is the region of momentum and energy deficit downwind, is important for optimising the wind farm layouts and operation to minimize costs. While in most weather situations (unstable atmospheric stratification), the wakes of wind turbines are only a local effect within the wind farm, satellite imagery reveals wind-farm wakes to be several tens of kilometres in length under certain conditions (stable atmospheric stratification), which is also predicted by numerical models. The first direct in situ measurements of the existence and shape of large wind farm wakes by a specially equipped research aircraft in 2016 and 2017 confirm wake lengths of more than tens of kilometres under stable atmospheric conditions, with maximum wind speed deficits of 40{\%}, and enhanced turbulence. These measurements were the first step in a large research project to describe and understand the physics of large offshore wakes using direct measurements, together with the assessment of satellite imagery and models.},

abstract = {Detailed aerodynamic information of local wind flow patterns in urban canopies is essential for the design of sustainable and resilient urban areas. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) can be used to analyze these complex flows, but uncertainties in the models can negatively impact the accuracy of the results. Data assimilation, using measurements from wind sensors located within the urban canopy, provides exciting opportunities to improve the quality of the predictions. The present study explores the deployment of several wind sensors on Stanford's campus to support future validation of CFD predictions with uncertainty quantification and data assimilation. We focus on uncertainty in the incoming wind direction and magnitude, and identify optimal sensor placement to enable accurate inference of these parameters. First, a set of Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes simulations is performed to build a surrogate model for the local velocity as a function of the inflow conditions. Subsequently, artificial wind observations are generated from realizations of the surrogate model, and an inverse ensemble Kalman filter is used to infer the inflow conditions from these observations. We investigate the influence of (1) the sensor location, (2) the number of sensors, and (3) the presence of noise or a bias in the measurement data. The analysis shows that multiple roof level sensors should enable robust assimilation of the inflow boundary conditions. In the future field experiment, sensors will be placed in these locations to validate the methodology using actual field measurement data.},

abstract = {The near-wall cycle of hybrid RANS/LES is studied by calculating the flow through a planar channel. Statistical results are commented on and related to instantaneous structures which are extracted from the flow field. The problematic structures in the artificial near-wall cycle, well known to be super-streaks, are identified and quantified. The calibration of such closures provides a correct mixing length argument in the logarithmic layer. However because of these overly intense streamwise streaks, it is impossible to simultaneously predict the Reynolds streamwise normal and shear stress components correctly. Further, because the location of the RANS-LES interface changes spatially and temporally, we see these structures are more free to move vertically and this further worsens statistical results.},

abstract = {This is an attempt to clarify and size up the many levels possible for the numerical prediction of a turbulent ¯ow, the target being a complete airplane, turbine, or car. Not all the author's opinions will be accepted, but his hope is to stimulate re¯ection, discussion, and planning. These levels still range from a solution of the steady Reynolds-Averaged Navier±Stokes (RANS) equations to a Direct Numerical Simulation, with Large-Eddy Simulation in between. However recent years have added intermediate strategies, dubbed ``VLES'', ``URANS'' and ``DES''. They are in experimental use and, although more expensive, threaten complex RANS models especially for blu-body and similar ¯ows. Turbulence predictions in aerodynamics face two principal challenges: (I) growth and separation of the boundary layer, and (II) momentum transfer after separation. (I) is simpler, but makes very high accuracy de- mands, and appears to give models of higher complexity little advantage. (II) is now the arena for complex RANS models and the newer strategies, by which time-dependent three-dimensional simulations are the norm even over two-dimensional geometries. In some strategies, grid re{\textregistered}nement is aimed at numerical accuracy; in others it is aimed at richer turbulence physics. In some ap- proaches, the empirical constants play a strong role even when the grid is very {\textregistered}ne; in others, their role vanishes. For several decades, practical methods will necessarily be RANS, possibly unsteady, or RANS/LES hybrids, pure LES being unaordable. Their em- pirical content will remain substantial, and the law of the wall will be particularly resistant. Estimates are oered of the grid res- olution needed for the application of each strategy to full-blown aerodynamic calculations, feeding into rough estimates of its feasibility date, based on computing-power growth.},

abstract = {Although an increased availability of computational resources has enabled high-fidelity simulations of turbulent flows, the RANS models are still the dominant tools for industrial applications. However, the predictive capabilities of RANS models are limited by potential inaccuracy driven by hypotheses in the Reynolds stress closure. Recently, a Physics-Informed Machine Learning (PIML) approach has been proposed to learn the functional form of Reynolds stress discrepancy in RANS simulations based on available data. It has been demonstrated that the learned discrepancy function can be used to improve Reynolds stresses in different flows where data are not available. However, owing to a number of challenges, the improvements have been demonstrated only in the Reynolds stress prediction but not in the corresponding propagated quantities of interest. In this work, we introduce the procedures toward a complete PIML framework for predictive turbulence modeling, including learning Reynolds stress discrepancy function, predicting Reynolds stresses in different flows, and propagating to mean flow fields. The process of Reynolds stress propagation and predictive accuracy of the propagated velocity field are investigated. To improve the learning-prediction performance, the input features are enriched based on an integrity basis of invariants. The fully developed turbulent flow in a square duct is used as the test case. The discrepancy model is trained on flow fields obtained from several Reynolds numbers and evaluated on a duct flow at a Reynolds number higher than any of the training cases. The predicted Reynolds stresses are propagated to velocity field through RANS equations. Numerical results show excellent predictive performances in both Reynolds stresses and their propagated velocities, demonstrating the merits of the PIML approach in predictive turbulence modeling.},

abstract = {Despite widespread adoption, machine learning models remain mostly black boxes. Understanding the reasons behind predictions is, however, quite important in assessing trust, which is fundamental if one plans to take action based on a prediction, or when choosing whether to deploy a new model. Such understanding also provides insights into the model, which can be used to transform an untrustworthy model or prediction into a trustworthy one. In this work, we propose LIME, a novel explanation technique that explains the predictions of any classifier in an interpretable and faithful manner, by learning an interpretable model locally around the prediction. We also propose a method to explain models by presenting representative individual predictions and their explanations in a non-redundant way, framing the task as a submodular optimization problem. We demonstrate the flexibility of these methods by explaining different models for text (e.g. random forests) and image classification (e.g. neural networks). We show the utility of explanations via novel experiments, both simulated and with human subjects, on various scenarios that require trust: deciding if one should trust a prediction, choosing between models, improving an untrustworthy classifier, and identifying why a classifier should not be trusted.},

abstract = {New turbulence and turbulent heat flux models are proposed for capturing flow and thermal fields bounded by walls or free surfaces. The models are constructed using locally definable quantities only, without any recourse to topographical parameters. For the flow field, the proposed model is a cubic nonlinear k-??-A three equation eddy viscosity model. It employs dependence on Lumley's stress flatness parameter A, by solving its modelled transport equation as the third variable. Since A vanishes at two-component turbulence boundaries, introducing its dependency enables a turbulence model to capture the structure of turbulence near shear-free surfaces as well as wall boundaries. To close the modelled A equation, an up-to-date second-moment closure is applied. For the thermal field, an explicit algebraic second-moment closure for turbulent heat flux is proposed. The new aspect of this heat flux model is the use of nonlinear Reynolds stress terms in the eddy diffusivity tensor. This model complies with the linearity and independence principles for passive scalar. The proposed models are tested in fully developed plane channel; open channel and plane Couette-Poiseuille flows at several fluid Prandtl numbers. The results show the very encouraging performance of the present proposals in capturing anisotropic turbulence and thermal fields near both wall and shear-free boundaries in the range of 0.025???Pr???95.

abstract = {A wide range of problems such as signal reconstruction, denoising, source separation, feature selection, and graphical model search are addressed today by posterior maximization for linear models with sparsity-favouring prior distributions. The Bayesian posterior contains useful information far beyond its mode, which can be used to drive methods for sampling optimization (active learning), feature relevance ranking, or hyperparameter estimation, if only this representation of uncertainty can be approximated in a tractable manner. In this paper, we review recent results for variational sparse inference, and show that they share underlying computational primitives. We discuss how sampling optimization can be implemented as sequential Bayesian experimental design. While there has been tremendous recent activity to develop sparse estimation, little attendance has been given to sparse approximate inference. In this paper, we argue that many problems in practice, such as compressive sensing for real-world image reconstruction, are served much better by proper uncertainty approximations than by ever more aggressive sparse estimation algorithms. Moreover, since some variational inference methods have been given strong convex optimization characterizations recently, theoretical analysis may become possible, promising new insights into nonlinear experimental design. 1. Introduction Most real-world signal classes of interest are highly structured. While precise high level statistical modelling of such structure is intractable at present, it imprints robust traces onto low level representations, which are in the feasible range of today's statistical methodology. For example, an image measured by a digital camera or a magnetic resonance scanner exhibits coherent edges, textures, and smooth areas, revealed by applying derivative or wavelet filters to the image bitmap: the filter responses show remarkably robust statistical behaviour far from Gaussianity (which would be obtained by filtering random noise) [1]. This low level statistical understanding, known as sparsity of image statistics, is used widely today in order to compress image bitmaps and video frame sequences. Similarly robust deviations from high-entropy Gaussianity occur for speech or music audio waveforms, leading to efficient compression schemes which can be decoded in real time. The statistical mechanisms underlying such low level applications are sparse linear models. The predominance of this technology for direct applications, such as coding and decoding (estimation), highlights the relevance of formulating and developing Bayesian frameworks, with which higher-order problems become accessible. In this paper, we will outline such a program, reviewing recent progress, as well as pointing out directions for research. A running example in this paper will be sampling design optimization for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) [2, 3], which has recently been addressed in [4]. In MRI, Fourier coefficients of},

However, the lasso does not give the estimate of error variance, and also the tuning parameter selection still remains an important issue. On the other hand, although the Bayesian lasso can determine the estimate of error variance and the value of a tuning parameter as some Bayesian point estimates, it is difficult to derive sparse solution for the estimates of regression coefficients. To overcome these drawbacks, we propose a MAP Bayesian lasso by using the Monte Carlo integration for the posterior approximation. Monte Carlo simulations and real data examples are conducted to examine the efficiency of the proposed procedure.},

However, based on the available information, it is not always easy to know how well a particular method will perform in a given situation and how it compares to other methods. This paper reviews most of the existing parameter choice methods, and evaluates and compares them in a large simulation study for spectral cut-off and Tikhonov regularization. The test cases cover a wide range of linear inverse problems with both white and colored stochastic noise. The results show some marked differences between the methods, in particular, in their stability with respect to the noise and its type. We conclude with a table of properties of the methods and a summary of the simulation results, from which we identify the best methods.},

abstract = {This work presents a data-driven approach to the identification of spatial and temporal truncation errors for linear and nonlinear discretization schemes of Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). Motivated by the central role of truncation errors, for example in the creation of implicit Large Eddy schemes, we introduce the Sparse Identification of Truncation Errors (SITE) framework to automatically identify the terms of the modified differential equation from simulation data. We build on recent advances in the field of data-driven discovery and control of complex systems and combine it with classical work on modified differential equation analysis of Warming, Hyett, Lerat and Peyret. We augment a sparse regression-rooted approach with appropriate preconditioning routines to aid in the identification of the individual modified differential equation terms. The construction of such a custom algorithm pipeline allows attenuating of multicollinearity effects as well as automatic tuning of the sparse regression hyperparameters using the Bayesian information criterion (BIC). As proof of concept, we constrain the analysis to finite difference schemes and leave other numerical schemes open for future inquiry. Test cases include the linear advection equation with a forward-time, backward-space discretization, the Burgers' equation with a MacCormack predictor-corrector scheme and the Korteweg-de Vries equation with a Zabusky and Kruska discretization scheme. Based on variation studies, we derive guidelines for the selection of discretization parameters, preconditioning approaches and sparse regression algorithms. The results showcase highly accurate predictions underlining the promise of SITE for the analysis and optimization of discretization schemes, where analytic derivation of modified differential equations is infeasible.},

abstract = {Multivariate time series data in practical applications, such as health care, geoscience, and biology, are characterized by a variety of missing values. In time series prediction and other related tasks, it has been noted that missing values and their missing patterns are often correlated with the target labels, a.k.a., informative missingness. There is very limited work on exploiting the missing patterns for effective imputation and improving prediction performance. In this paper, we develop novel deep learning models, namely GRU-D, as one of the early attempts. GRU-D is based on Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), a state-of-the-art recurrent neural network. It takes two representations of missing patterns, i.e., masking and time interval, and effectively incorporates them into a deep model architecture so that it not only captures the long-term temporal dependencies in time series, but also utilizes the missing patterns to achieve better prediction results. Experiments of time series classification tasks on real-world clinical datasets (MIMIC-III, PhysioNet) and synthetic datasets demonstrate that our models achieve state-of-the-art performance and provide useful insights for better understanding and utilization of missing values in time series analysis.},

abstract = {The predictive properties of several non-linear eddy-viscosity models are investigated by reference to highly-resolved LES data obtained by the authors for an internal flow featuring massive separation from a curved surface. The test geometry is a periodic segment of a channel constricted by two-dimensional (2D) `hills' on the lower wall. The mean-flow Reynolds number is 21560. Periodic boundary conditions are applied in the streamwise and spanwise directions. This makes the statistical properties of the simulated flow genuinely 2D and independent from boundary conditions, except at the walls. The simulation was performed on a high-quality, 5M-node grid. The focus of the study is on the exploitation of the LES data for the mean-flow, Reynolds stresses and macro-length-scale. Model solutions are first compared with the LES data, and selected models are then subjected to a-priori studies designed to elucidate the role of specific model fragments in the non-linear stress-strain/vorticity relation and their contribution to observed defects in the mean-flow and turbulence fields. The role of the equation governing the length-scale, via different surrogate variables, is also investigated. It is shown that, while most non-linear models overestimate the separation region, due mainly to model defects that result in insufficient shear stress in the separated shear layer, model forms can be derived which provide a satisfactory representation of the flow. One such model is identified. This combines a particular quadratic constitutive relation with a wall-anisotropy term, a high-normal-strain correction and a new form of the equation for the specific dissipation $\omega$ = ∈/k.},

abstract = {AbstractThis work describes the derivation of an algebraic model for the Reynolds stresses and turbulent heat flux in stably stratified turbulent flows, which are mutually coupled for this type of flow. For general two-dimensional mean flows, we present a correct way of expressing the Reynolds-stress anisotropy and the (normalized) turbulent heat flux as tensorial combinations of the mean strain rate, the mean rotation rate, the mean temperature gradient and gravity. A system of linear equations is derived for the coefficients in these expansions, which can easily be solved with computer algebra software for a specific choice of the model constants. The general model is simplified in the case of parallel mean shear flows where the temperature gradient is aligned with gravity. For this case, fully explicit and coupled expressions for the Reynolds-stress tensor and heat-flux vector are given. A self-consistent derivation of this model would, however, require finding a root of a polynomial equation of sixth-order, for which no simple analytical expression exists. Therefore, the nonlinear part of the algebraic equations is modelled through an approximation that is close to the consistent formulation. By using the framework of a {\$}K\backslashtext{\{}{\{}\backslashndash{\}}{\}} \backslashomega {\$} model (where {\$}K{\$} is turbulent kinetic energy and {\$}\backslashomega {\$} an inverse time scale) and, where needed, near-wall corrections, the model is applied to homogeneous shear flow and turbulent channel flow, both with stable stratification. For the case of homogeneous shear flow, the model predicts a critical Richardson number of 0.25 above which the turbulent kinetic energy decays to zero. The channel-flow results agree well with DNS data. Furthermore, the model is shown to be robust and approximately self-consistent. It also fulfils the requirements of realizability.},

abstract = {Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) simulations with turbulence models continue to play important roles in industrial flow simulations as high-fidelity simulations are prohibitively expensive for such flows. Commonly used linear eddy viscosity models are intrinsically unable to handle flows with non-equilibrium turbulence (e.g., flows with massive separation). Reynolds stress models, on the other hand, are plagued by their lack of robustness and stability. Recent studies found that even substituting Reynolds stresses from DNS databases (with errors below 0.5{\%}) into RANS equations leads to grossly inaccurate velocities. Such an observation is not only disturbing for the recently emerging data-driven Reynolds stress models but also relevant for traditional, equation-based models. This observation cannot be explained by the global matrix condition number of the discretized RANS equations. In this work, we propose a metric based on local condition numbers for a priori evaluation of the stability of Reynolds stress models. Numerical tests on turbulent channel flows at various Reynolds numbers suggest that the proposed metric can adequately explain observations in previous studies, i.e., decreased model stability with increasing Reynolds number, and better stability of the implicit treatment of Reynolds stress compared to the explicit treatment.},

We present a universal, data-driven decomposition of chaos as an intermittently forced linear system. This work combines Takens' delay embedding with modern Koopman operator theory and sparse regression to obtain linear representations of strongly nonlinear dynamics. The result is a decomposition of chaotic dynamics into a linear model in the leading delay coordinates with forcing by low energy delay coordinates; we call this the Hankel alternative view of Koopman (HAVOK) analysis. This analysis is applied to the canonical Lorenz system, as well as to real-world examples such as the Earth's magnetic field reversal, and data from electrocardiogram, electroencephalogram, and measles outbreaks. In each case, the forcing statistics are non-Gaussian, with long tails corresponding to rare events that trigger intermittent switching and bursting phenomena; this forcing is highly predictive, providing a clear signature that precedes these events. Moreover, the activity of the forcing signal demarcates large coherent regions of phase space where the dynamics are approximately linear from those that are strongly nonlinear.},

@article{Lu2016,
abstract = {A researcher can infer mathematical expressions of
functions quickly by using his professional knowledge (called
Prior Knowledge). But the results he finds may be biased and
restricted to his research field due to limitation of his knowledge. 
In contrast, Genetic Programming method can discover fitted
mathematical expressions from the huge search space through
running evolutionary algorithms. And its results can be generalized
to accommodate different fields of knowledge. However,
since GP has to search a huge space, its speed of finding the
results is rather slow. Therefore, in this paper, a framework
of connection between Prior Formula Knowledge and GP (PFK-GP)
is proposed to reduce the space of GP searching. The PFK
is built based on the Deep Belief Network (DBN) which can
identify candidate formulas that are consistent with the features
of experimental data. By using these candidate formulas as the
seed of a randomly generated population, PFK-GP finds the right
formulas quickly by exploring the search space of data features. 
We have compared PFK-GP with Pareto GP on regression of
eight benchmark problems. The experimental results confirm
that the PFK-GP can reduce the search space and obtain the
significant improvement in the quality of SR.},

abstract = {In this paper we are concerned with obtaining estimates for the error in Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) simulations based on the Launder-Sharma k $\epsilon$ turbulence closure model, for a limited class of flows. In particular we search for estimates grounded in uncertainties in the space of model closure coefficients, for wall-bounded flows at a variety of favorable and adverse pressure gradients. In order to estimate the spread of closure coefficients which reproduces these flows accurately, we perform 13 separate Bayesian calibrations - each at a different pressure gradient - using measured boundary-layer velocity profiles, and a statistical model containing a multiplicative model-inadequacy term in the solution space. The results are 13 joint posterior distributions over coefficients and hyper-parameters. To summarize this information we compute Highest Posterior-Density (HPD) intervals, and subsequently represent the total solution uncertainty with a probability-box (p-box). This p-box represents both parameter variability across flows, and epistemic uncertainty within each calibration. A prediction of a new boundary-layer flow is made with uncertainty bars generated from this uncertainty information, and the resulting error estimate is shown to be consistent with measurement data. {\textcopyright} 2013.},

The machine-learned reconstruction of the discrepancy is then used within the RANS partial differential equation solver for predictions. The methodology is applied to problems involving transonic flow over an axisymmetric bump and oblique shock-boundary layer interaction. The ability of the model to assimilate data (pressure and velocity) while predicting other quantities (Reynolds stresses) is studied. Different approaches to infer discrepancies are compared, including a form that preserves a log-layer constraint in the SA model. The},

@article{Ling2016d,
abstract = {In many scientific fields, empirical models are employed to facilitate computational simulations of engineering systems. For example, in fluid mechanics, empirical Reynolds stress closures enable computationally-efficient Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes simulations. Likewise, in solid mechanics, constitutive relations between the stress and strain in a material are required in deformation analysis. Traditional methods for developing and tuning empirical models usually combine physical intuition with simple regression techniques on limited data sets. The rise of high performance computing has led to a growing availability of high fidelity simulation data. These data open up the possibility of using machine learning algorithms, such as random forests or neural networks, to develop more accurate and general empirical models. A key question when using data-driven algorithms to develop these empirical models is how domain knowledge should be incorporated into the machine learning process. This paper will specifically address physical systems that possess symmetry or invariance properties. Two different methods for teaching a machine learning model an invariance property are compared. In the first method, a basis of invariant inputs is constructed, and the machine learning model is trained upon this basis, thereby embedding the invariance into the model. In the second method, the algorithm is trained on multiple transformations of the raw input data until the model learns invariance to that transformation. Results are discussed for two case studies: one in turbulence modeling and one in crystal elasticity. It is shown that in both cases embedding the invariance property into the input features yields higher performance at significantly reduced computational training costs.},

abstract = {Many measurements are required to control thermonuclear plasmas and to fully exploit them scientifically. In the last years JET has shown the potential to generate about 50 GB of data per shot. These amounts of data require more sophisticated data analysis methodologies to perform correct inference and various techniques have been recently developed in this respect. The present paper covers a new methodology to extract mathematical models directly from the data without any a priori assumption about their expression. The approach, based on symbolic regression via genetic programming, is exemplified using the data of the International Tokamak Physics Activity database for the energy confinement time. The best obtained scaling laws are not in power law form and suggest a revisiting of the extrapolation to ITER. Indeed the best non-power law scalings predict confinement times in ITER approximately between 2 and 3 s. On the other hand, more comprehensive and better databases are required to fully profit from the power of these new methods and to discriminate between the hundreds of thousands of models that they can generate.},

abstract = {New closure approximations are proposed, within the framework of non-linear eddy-viscosity modeling, which aim specifically at an improved representation of near-wall anisotropy in both shear and stagnation flows. The main novel element is the introduction of tensorial terms, alongside strain and vorticity, which depend on wall-direction indicators and which procure the correct asymptotic near-wall behavior of the Reynolds stresses. The newly formulated non-linear constitutive equation for the Reynolds stresses is combined with low-Reynolds-number forms of equations for the rate of dissipation $\epsilon$ or the specific dissipation $\omega$, the latter incorporating a number of new features into the established form of the equation. The predictive performance of three model variants is investigated by reference to three test flows: A plane channel flow, a separated flow in a channel with periodic hill-shaped obstacles on one wall and a plane impinging jet. It is shown that the new model elements result in a substantially improved representation of the Reynolds-stress field at the wall, especially in the wall-normal Reynolds stress. One of the variants includes the use of the modified $\omega$-equation, and it is shown that this model performs especially well in the presence of separation. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

abstract = {In nature and in flow experiments particles form patterns of swirling motion in certain locations. Existing approaches identify these structures by considering the behavior of stream lines. However, in unsteady flows particle motion is described by path lines which generally gives different swirling patterns than stream lines. We introduce a novel mathematical characterization of swirling motion cores in unsteady flows by generalizing the approach of Sujudi/Haimes to path lines. The cores of swirling particle motion are lines sweeping over time, i.e., surfaces in the space-time domain. They occur at locations where three derived 4D vectors become coplanar. To extract them, we show how to re-formulate the problem using the Parallel Vectors operator. We apply our method to a number of unsteady flow fields.},

For the two-dimensional separated  models was found to have a critical effect on the predictive accuracy of the model (and, in particular, of separation and reattachment points). None of the wall treatments tested resulted in accurate predic- tion of the flow field. Better results were obtained with models that do not require special treatment in the inner layer ( f, k , and Spalart–Allmaras models). For the square duct calculation, only a nonlinear constitutive relation was found to be able to capture the secondary flow, giving results in agreement with the data. Linear models had signifi- cant error. DOI: 10.1115/1.4003425},

abstract = {The past years have witnessed many dedicated open-source projects that built and maintain implementations of Support Vector Machines (SVM), parallelized for GPU, multi-core CPUs and distributed systems. Up to this point, no comparable effort has been made to parallelize the Elastic Net, despite its popularity in many high impact applications, including genetics, neuroscience and systems biology. The first contribution in this paper is of theoretical nature. We establish a tight link between two seemingly different algorithms and prove that Elastic Net regression can be reduced to SVM with squared hinge loss classification. Our second contribution is to derive a practical algorithm based on this reduction. The reduction enables us to utilize prior efforts in speeding up and parallelizing SVMs to obtain a highly optimized and parallel solver for the Elastic Net and Lasso. With a simple wrapper, consisting of only 11 lines of MATLAB code, we obtain an Elastic Net implementation that naturally utilizes GPU and multi-core CPUs. We demonstrate on twelve real world data sets, that our algorithm yields identical results as the popular (and highly optimized) glmnet implementation but is one or several orders of magnitude faster.},

abstract = {Couette flow is solved for with conventional Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) turbulence models, without temporal (t) or streamwise (x) dependence, but with periodic conditions in the lateral (z) direction and non-zero velocity components in all three directions. Thus, (U, V, W) are functions of (y, z), instead of only U being a function of y as in the simple application of RANS. This is motivated by experimental and Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) observations of large and powerful streamwise vortices with minimal t and x dependence, which raised the possibility that RANS models may allow similar vortices to form. Indeed we find that some models support vortices which, when viewed as a form of turbulence with respect to z-averaging, make a large (near 50{\%}) contribution to the momentum transport in the core region of the channel and tangibly increase the skin-friction coefficient Cf at a given Reynolds number, in broad agreement with DNS results and some experiments. To date, only eddy-viscosity models equipped with a Quadratic Constitutive Relation (QCR) have succeeded in creating vortices. The Linear Eddy-Viscosity Models tested damp the vortices, even when computations are started from converged solutions with QCR and vortices. Surprisingly, an Explicit Algebraic Reynolds Stress Model also failed to generate vortices. The impact of the vortices on the composite RANS solutions may partly explain the experimental scatter. It is also a warning that DNS results will depend noticeably on the lateral period, unless it is made very large.},

abstract = {The response of homogeneous turbulence to rapid mean-flow compression in idealized internal combustion engines and rapid compression machines is examined using a hierarchy of closure models for the Reynolds stress anisotropy. This hierarchy is based on a Reynolds stress anisotropy transport equation that is modeled from the exact transport equation for the anisotropy. The hierarchy of models includes a recently- developed non-equilibrium model, which is shown to be in good agreement with more computationally-complex fully differential models. Using this hierarchical approach, the flow physics addressed by each closure is identified and closure accuracy is shown to depend on the degree to which non-equilibrium turbulent flow effects are captured. We examine the evolution of the turbulence kinetic energy, Reynolds stresses, and anisotropy as a function of the degree of non-equilibrium in the flow, which is parameterized by the ratio of characteristic turbulence and mean-flow deformation time scales. By comparing model results to results obtained from rapid distortion theory and higher level closures, prescriptions are provided for the applicability of different closure models based on the magnitude of the non-equilibrium parameter. The theoretical analysis is complemented by comparisons of simulation results with previously established direct numerical simulations for a one-dimensional compression. Finally,we connect these prescriptions with experimen- tal measurements of turbulent and mean-flow time scales for internal combustion engines operating at realistic conditions. Keywords},

abstract = {With the ever-increasing use of Reynolds-Averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) simulations in mission-critical applications, the quantification of model-form uncertainty in RANS models has attracted attention in the turbulence modeling community. Recently, a physics-based nonparametric approach for quantifying model-form uncertainty in RANS simulations has been proposed, where Reynolds stresses are projected to physically meaningful dimensions and perturbations are introduced only in the physically realizable limits (Xiao et al., 2016). However, a challenge associated with this approach is to assess the amount of information introduced in the prior distribution and to avoid imposing unwarranted constraints. In this work we propose a random matrix approach for quantifying model-form uncertainties in RANS simulations with the realizability of the Reynolds stress guaranteed, which is achieved by construction from the Cholesky factorization of the normalized Reynolds stress tensor. Furthermore, the maximum entropy principle is used to identify the probability distribution that satisfies the constraints from available information but without introducing artificial constraints. We demonstrate that the proposed approach is able to ensure the realizability of the Reynolds stress, albeit in a different manner from the physics-based approach. Monte Carlo sampling of the obtained probability distribution is achieved by using polynomial chaos expansion to map independent Gaussian random fields to the Reynolds stress random field with the marginal distributions and correlation structures as specified. Numerical simulations on a typical flow with separation have shown physically reasonable results, which verify the proposed approach. Therefore, the proposed method is a promising alternative to the physics-based approach for model-form uncertainty quantification of RANS simulations. The method explored in this work is general and can be extended to other complex physical systems in applied mechanics and engineering. {\textcopyright} 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

By looking at the velocity directions of the neighbourhood of a point we decide if there is rotation. A measure of the strength of rotation at the point is also introduced based on the magnitude of the velocity components in the neighbourhood. The method is tested on simulated data and per- forms well. Finally a Lagrangian identification method (Direct Lyapunov Exponents) is used to attempt to calibrate the $\lambda$2-criterion in order to match an objectively defined edge. The results here show that it might not be possible to find a $\lambda$2 threshold to match edges found using the DLE method. 1},

abstract = {Turbulence modeling is a critical component in numerical simulations of industrial flows based on Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations. However, after decades of efforts in the turbulence modeling community, universally applicable RANS models with predictive capabilities are still lacking. Recently, data-driven methods have been proposed as a promising alternative to the traditional approaches of turbulence model development. In this work we propose a data-driven, physics-informed machine learning approach for predicting discrepancies in RANS modeled Reynolds stresses. The discrepancies are formulated as functions of the mean flow features. By using a modern machine learning technique based on random forests, the discrepancy functions are first trained with benchmark flow data and then used to predict Reynolds stresses discrepancies in new flows. The method is used to predict the Reynolds stresses in the flow over periodic hills by using two training flow scenarios of increasing difficulties: (1) the flow in the same periodic hills geometry yet at a lower Reynolds number, and (2) the flow in a different hill geometry with a similar recirculation zone. Excellent predictive performances were observed in both scenarios, demonstrating the merits of the proposed method. Improvement of RANS modeled Reynolds stresses enabled by the proposed method is an important step towards predictive turbulence modeling, where the ultimate goal is to predict the quantities of interest (e.g., velocity field, drag, lift) more accurately by solving RANS equations with the Reynolds stresses obtained therefrom.},

abstract = {These lecture notes highlight the mathematical and computational structure relating to the formulation of, and development of algorithms for, the Bayesian approach to inverse problems in differential equations. This approach is fundamental in the quantification of uncertainty within applications in volving the blending of mathematical models with data. The finite dimensional situation is described first, along with some motivational examples. Then the development of probability measures on separable Banach space is undertaken, using a random series over an infinite set of functions to construct draws; these probability measures are used as priors in the Bayesian approach to inverse problems. Regularity of draws from the priors is studied in the natural Sobolev or Besov spaces implied by the choice of functions in the random series construction, and the Kolmogorov continuity theorem is used to extend regularity considerations to the space of H{\"{o}}lder continuous functions. Bayes' theorem is de rived in this prior setting, and here interpreted as finding conditions under which the posterior is absolutely continuous with respect to the prior, and determining a formula for the Radon-Nikodym derivative in terms of the likelihood of the data. Having established the form of the posterior, we then describe various properties common to it in the infinite dimensional setting. These properties include well-posedness, approximation theory, and the existence of maximum a posteriori estimators. We then describe measure-preserving dynamics, again on the infinite dimensional space, including Markov chain-Monte C arlo and sequential Monte Carlo methods, and measure-preserving reversible stochastic differential equations. By formulating the theory and algorithms on the underlying infinite dimensional space, we obtain a framework suitable for rigorous analysis of the accuracy of reconstructions, of computational complexity, as well as naturally constructing algorithms which perform well under mesh refinement, since they are inherently well-defined in infinite dimensions.},

abstract = {The first direct gravitational-wave detection was made by the Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory on September 14, 2015. The GW150914 signal was strong enough to be apparent, without using any waveform model, in the filtered detector strain data. Here those features of the signal visible in these data are used, along with only such concepts from Newtonian and General Relativity as are accessible to anyone with a general physics background. The simple analysis presented here is consistent with the fully general-relativistic analyses published elsewhere, in showing that the signal was produced by the inspiral and subsequent merger of two black holes. The black holes were each of approximately 35 Msun, still orbited each other as close as 350 km apart and subsequently merged to form a single black hole. Similar reasoning, directly from the data, is used to roughly estimate how far these black holes were from the Earth, and the energy that they radiated in gravitational waves.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017. International Society for Bayesian Analysis. Penalized regression methods such as the lasso and elastic net (EN) have become popular for simultaneous variable selection and coefficient estimation. Implementation of these methods require selection of the penalty parameters. We propose an empirical Bayes (EB) methodology for selecting these tuning parameters as well as computation of the regularization path plots. The EB method does not suffer from the "double shrinkage problem" of frequentist EN. Also it avoids the difficulty of constructing an appropriate prior on the penalty parameters. The EB methodology is implemented by efficient importance sampling method based on multiple Gibbs sampler chains. Since the Markov chains underlying the Gibbs sampler are proved to be geometrically ergodic, Markov chain central limit theorem can be used to provide asymptotically valid confidence band for profiles of EN coefficients. The practical effectiveness of our method is illustrated by several simulation examples and two real life case studies. Although this article considers lasso and EN for brevity, the proposed EB method is general and can be used to select shrinkage parameters in other regularization methods.},

abstract = {Urban physics is the science and engineering of physical processes in urban areas. It basically refers to the transfer of heat and mass in the outdoor and indoor urban environment, and its interaction with humans, fauna, flora and materials. Urban physics is a rapidly increasing focus area as it is key to understanding and addressing the grand societal challenges climate change, energy, health, security, transport and aging. The main assessment tools in urban physics are field measurements, full-scale and reduced-scale laboratory measurements and numerical simulation methods including Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). In the past 50 years, CFD has undergone a successful transition from an emerging field into an increasingly established field in urban physics research, practice and design. This review and position paper consists of two parts. In the first part, the importance of urban physics related to the grand societal challenges is described, after which the spatial and temporal scales in urban physics and the associated model categories are outlined. In the second part, based on a brief theoretical background, some views on CFD are provided. Possibilities and limitations are discussed, and in particular, ten tips and tricks towards accurate and reliable CFD simulations are presented. These tips and tricks are certainly not intended to be complete, rather they are intended to complement existing CFD best practice guidelines on ten particular aspects. Finally, an outlook to the future of CFD for urban physics is given.},

abstract = {The aim of this introduction is to bring into focus the basic differences between gene expression programming (GEP) and its predecessors, genetic algorithms (GAs) and genetic pro-gramming (GP). According to Mitchell (1996), gene expres-sion programming is, like GAs and GP, a genetic algorithm as it uses populations of individuals, selects them according to fitness, and introduces genetic variation using one or more genetic operators. The fundamental difference between the three algorithms resides in the nature of the individuals: in GAs the individuals are symbolic strings of fixed length (chromosomes); in GP the individuals are non-linear entities of different sizes and shapes (parse trees); and in GEP the individuals are encoded as symbolic strings of fixed length (chromosomes) which are then expressed as non-linear enti-ties of different sizes and shapes (expression trees). 1.1. Genetic algorithms Genetic algorithms, invented by J. Holland in the 1960s, ap-plied biological evolution theory to computer systems (Hol-land 1975). Like all evolutionary computer systems, GAs are an oversimplification of biological evolution. In this case, solutions to a problem are encoded in character strings (usu-ally 0's and 1's), and a population of these solutions is left to evolve in order to find a solution to the problem at hand. Populations, and therefore solutions, evolve because indi-vidual solutions (chromosomes) reproduce with modifica-tion. This is obviously the prerequisite for evolution to occur.

abstract = {The data-driven discovery of dynamics via machine learning is currently pushing the frontiers of modeling and control efforts, and it provides a tremendous opportunity to extend the reach of model predictive control. However, many leading methods in machine learning, such as neural networks, require large volumes of training data, may not be interpretable, do not easily include known constraints and symmetries, and often do not generalize beyond the attractor where models are trained. These factors limit the use of these techniques for the online identification of a model in the low-data limit, for example following an abrupt change to the system dynamics. In this work, we extend the recent sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDY) modeling procedure to include the effects of actuation and demonstrate the ability of these models to enhance the performance of model predictive control (MPC), based on limited, noisy data. SINDY models are parsimonious, identifying the fewest terms in the model needed to explain the data, making them interpretable, generalizable, and reducing the burden of training data. We show that the resulting SINDY-MPC framework has higher performance, requires significantly less data, and is more computationally efficient and robust to noise than neural network models, making it viable for online training and execution in response to rapid changes to the system. SINDY-MPC also shows improved performance over linear data-driven models, although linear models may provide a stopgap until enough data is available for SINDY. SINDY-MPC is demonstrated on a variety of dynamical systems with different challenges, including the chaotic Lorenz system, a simple model for flight control of an F8 aircraft, and an HIV model incorporating drug treatment.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {A critical challenge in the data-driven modeling of dynamical systems is producing methods robust to measurement error, particularly when data is limited. Many leading methods either rely on denoising prior to learning or on access to large volumes of data to average over the effect of noise. We propose a novel paradigm for data-driven modeling that simultaneously learns the dynamics and estimates the measurement noise at each observation. By constraining our learning algorithm, our method explicitly accounts for measurement error in the map between observations, treating both the measurement error and the dynamics as unknowns to be identified, rather than assuming idealized noiseless trajectories. We model the unknown vector field using a deep neural network, imposing a Runge-Kutta integrator structure to isolate this vector field, even when the data has a non-uniform timestep, thus constraining and focusing the modeling effort. We demonstrate the ability of this framework to form predictive models on a variety of canonical test problems of increasing complexity and show that it is robust to substantial amounts of measurement error. We also discuss issues with the generalizability of neural network models for dynamical systems and provide open-source code for all examples.},

abstract = {Regularized regression problems are ubiquitous in statistical modeling, signal processing, and machine learning. Sparse regression in particular has been instrumental in scientific model discovery, including compressed sensing applications, variable selection, and high-dimensional analysis. We propose a broad framework for sparse relaxed regularized regression, called SR3. The key idea is to solve a relaxation of the regularized problem, which has three advantages over the state-of-the-art: (1) solutions of the relaxed problem are superior with respect to errors, false positives, and conditioning, (2) relaxation allows extremely fast algorithms for both convex and nonconvex formulations, and (3) the methods apply to composite regularizers such as total variation (TV) and its nonconvex variants. We demonstrate the advantages of SR3 (computational efficiency, higher accuracy, faster convergence rates, greater flexibility) across a range of regularized regression problems with synthetic and real data, including applications in compressed sensing, LASSO, matrix completion, TV regularization, and group sparsity. To promote reproducible research, we also provide a companion MATLAB package that implements these examples.},

This paper presents a method of using deep neural networks to learn a model for the Reynolds stress anisotropy tensor from high-fidelity simulation data. A novel neural network architecture is proposed which uses a multiplicative layer with an invariant tensor basis to embed Galilean invariance into the predicted anisotropy tensor. It is demonstrated that this neural network architecture provides improved prediction accuracy compared with a generic neural network architecture that does not embed this invariance property. The Reynolds stress anisotropy predictions of this invariant neural network are propagated through to the velocity field for two test cases. For both test cases, significant improvement versus baseline RANS linear eddy viscosity and nonlinear eddy viscosity models is demonstrated.},

In order to produce continuous analyses with time. VDRAS was implemented with a cycling procedure. in which the analysis from the previous cycle is used as a first guess and background for the next cycle. Other enhancements in this real-time system include direct assimilation of data on constant elevation angle levels. addition of mesonet observations. inclusion of an analysis background term. and continuous updating of lateral boundary conditions. An observed case of a line of storms and strong outflow is used to examine the performance of the real-rime analysis system and its sensitivity to various system changes. The quality of the analysis for this case is examined by comparing the subsequent 90-min forecast with the observed radial velocity. It is shown that the forecast initialized using the VDRAS analysis outperforms persistence and a forecast using a mesoscale analysis. The accuracy of the retrieved wind in six convective cases is also verified against automated weather reports from commercial aircraft data. The verification shows an average difference of 3.3 m s(-1) over these six cases.},

abstract = {Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations are widely used in engineering turbulent flow simulations. However, RANS predictions may have large discrepancies due to the uncertainties in modeled Reynolds stresses. Recently, Wang et al. demonstrated that machine learning can be used to improve the RANS modeled Reynolds stresses by leveraging data from high fidelity simulations (Physics informed machine learning approach for reconstructing Reynolds stress modeling discrepancies based on DNS data. Physical Review Fluids. 2, 034603, 2017). However, solving for mean flows from the improved Reynolds stresses still poses significant challenges due to potential ill-conditioning of RANS equations with Reynolds stress closures. Enabling improved predictions of mean velocities are of profound practical importance, because often the velocity and its derived quantities (QoIs, e.g., drag, lift, surface friction), and not the Reynolds stress itself, are of ultimate interest in RANS simulations. To this end, we present a comprehensive framework for augmenting turbulence models with physics-informed machine learning, illustrating a complete workflow from identification of input features to final prediction of mean velocities. This work has two innovations. First, we demonstrate a systematic procedure to generate mean flow features based on the integrity basis for mean flow tensors. Second, we propose using machine learning to predict linear and nonlinear parts of the Reynolds stress tensor separately. Inspired by the finite polynomial representation of tensors in classical turbulence modeling, such a decomposition is instrumental in overcoming the ill-conditioning of RANS equations. Numerical tests demonstrated merits of the proposed framework.},

We review recent literature on data-free (uncertainty propagation) and data-driven (statistical inference) approaches for quantifying and reducing model uncertainties in RANS simulations. Moreover, the fundamentals of uncertainty propagation and Bayesian inference are introduced in the context of RANS model uncertainty quantification. Finally, the literature on uncertainties in scale-resolving simulations is briefly reviewed with particular emphasis on large eddy simulations.},

abstract = {Turbulence modeling is a critical component in numerical simulations of industrial flows based on Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations. However, after decades of efforts in the turbulence modeling community, universally applicable RANS models with predictive capabilities are still lacking. Recently, data-driven methods have been proposed as a promising alternative to the traditional approaches of turbulence model development. In this work we propose a data-driven, physics-informed machine learning approach for predicting discrepancies in RANS modeled Reynolds stresses. The discrepancies are formulated as functions of the mean flow features. By using a modern machine learning technique based on random forests, the discrepancy functions are first trained with benchmark flow data and then used to predict Reynolds stresses discrepancies in new flows. The method is used to predict the Reynolds stresses in the flow over periodic hills by using two training flow scenarios of increasing difficulties: (1) the flow in the same periodic hills geometry yet at a lower Reynolds number, and (2) the flow in a different hill geometry with a similar recirculation zone. Excellent predictive performances were observed in both scenarios, demonstrating the merits of the proposed method. Improvement of RANS modeled Reynolds stresses enabled by the proposed method is an important step towards predictive turbulence modeling, where the ultimate goal is to predict the quantities of interest (e.g., velocity field, drag, lift) more accurately by solving RANS equations with the Reynolds stresses obtained therefrom.},

abstract = {A numerical study of scalar dispersion is presented to investigate the effectiveness of pairing the v2-f turbulence model with algebraic models for the scalar flux. This approach is contrasted with utilizing a full Second Moment Closure (SMC) as the flow field input to the scalar model. Predictions of scalar transport in a turbulent channel and over a wavy wall are compared to available DNS databases. The latter case includes a scalar release from a point source and therefore detailed comparisons of the three-component turbulent scalar flux are reported. It is found that the transported variable v2, representing the near wall turbulent velocity fluctuation scale, can be used to increase the level of normal stress anisotropy provided to algebraic scalar models and thereby improve mean scalar prediction over that of the Standard Gradient Diffusion Hypothesis (SGDH). Improvement is most significant in the near wall region. Three specifications of the normal stresses, derived from v2, are considered to provide the link from the v2-f model to the algebraic flux models used to close the scalar transport equation. Barycentric maps are used to examine the state of turbulence anisotropy in each case. As the anisotropy in the normal stress specification becomes more accurate, improvements are realized in the prediction of the spanwise flux as well as the mean concentration. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

In particular, complete Reynolds-stress budgets are reported for the first time. Instantaneous visualisations reveal partial relaminarisation along the inner surface of the curved pipe at the highest curvature, whereas developed turbulence is always maintained at the outer side. The mean flow shows asymmetry in the axial velocity profile and distinct Dean vortices as secondary motions. For strong curvature a distinct bulge appears close to the pipe centre, which has previously been observed in laminar and transitional curved pipes at lower Rebonly. On the other hand, mild curvature allows the interesting observation of a friction factor which is lower than in a straight pipe for the same flow rate. All statistical data, including mean profile, fluctuations and the Reynolds-stress budgets, is available for development and validation of turbulence models in curved geometries. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {We consider prediction and uncertainty analysis for systems which are approximated using complex mathematical models. Such models, implemented as computer codes, are often generic in the sense that by a suitable choice of some of the model's input parameters the code can be used to predict the behaviour of the system in a variety of specific applications. However, in any specific application the values of necessary parameters may be unknown. In this case, physical observations of the system in the specific context are used to learn about the unknown parameters. The process of fitting the model to the observed data by adjusting the parameters is known as calibration. Calibration is typically effected by ad hoc fitting, and after calibration the model is used, with the fitted input values, to predict the future behaviour of the system. We present a Bayesian calibration technique which improves on this traditional approach in two respects. First, the predictions allow for all sources of uncertainty, including the remaining uncertainty over the fitted parameters. Second, they attempt to correct for any inadequacy of the model which is revealed by a discrepancy between the observed data and the model predictions from even the best-fitting parameter values. The method is illustrated by using data from a nuclear radiation release at Tomsk, and from a more complex simulated nuclear accident exercise.},

@article{VanErp2019,
abstract = {In linear regression problems with many predictors, penalized regression techniques are often used to guard against overfitting and to select variables relevant for predicting an outcome variable. Recently, Bayesian penalization is becoming increasingly popular in which the prior distribution performs a function similar to that of the penalty term in classical penalization. Specifically, the so-called shrinkage priors in Bayesian penalization aim to shrink small effects to zero while maintaining true large effects. Compared to classical penalization techniques, Bayesian penalization techniques perform similarly or sometimes even better, and they offer additional advantages such as readily available uncertainty estimates, automatic estimation of the penalty parameter, and more flexibility in terms of penalties that can be considered. However, many different shrinkage priors exist and the available, often quite technical, literature primarily focuses on presenting one shrinkage prior and often provides comparisons with only one or two other shrinkage priors. This can make it difficult for researchers to navigate through the many prior options and choose a shrinkage prior for the problem at hand. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to provide a comprehensive overview of the literature on Bayesian penalization. We provide a theoretical and conceptual comparison of nine different shrinkage priors and parametrize the priors, if possible, in terms of scale mixture of normal distributions to facilitate comparisons. We illustrate different characteristics and behaviors of the shrinkage priors and compare their performance in terms of prediction and variable selection in a simulation study. Additionally, we provide two empirical examples to illustrate the application of Bayesian penalization. Finally, an R package bayesreg is available online (https://github.com/sara-vanerp/bayesreg) which allows researchers to perform Bayesian penalized regression with novel shrinkage priors in an easy manner.},

abstract = {Within MAP, one of the scientific projects was devoted to ‘Boundary Layers in Complex Terrain'. In a number of subprojects, boundary-layer issues were addressed and detailed high-resolution multi-sensor observations were combined with simulation by models allowing for adequate parametrization of turbulence processes. In this contribution, the projects are briefly introduced and an attempt is made to summarize their key findings and to put them into a joint perspective. Spatial variability is found to be large but strictly related to topography and therefore allowing for possible parametrization. Traditional boundary-layer scaling approaches cannot simply be applied over highly complex topography, but some of the MAP findings suggest the potential for suitable extensions of those scaling relations to cover various cases of complex terrain. The mean boundary-layer structure and thermally driven flows in narrow valleys are found not to be generally in line with previous results from larger valleys elsewhere. Furthermore, local circulations are reported to contribute considerably to exchange between valley and free troposphere. In particular, the range of their effects on the lower atmosphere seems to be larger than just turbulent transport within the planetary boundary layer would suggest. Thus in larger-scale numerical models where the topography is not resolved, possible sub-grid parametrizations for local exchange seem to be in order.},

abstract = {The accuracy of low-fidelity models of turbulent flow such as those based on the Reynolds Averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) equations can be questionable, especially when these models are applied in situations different from those in which the models were calibrated. At present, there is no general method to quantify structural uncertainties in such models. Greater accuracy and a reliable quantification of modeling errors is much needed to expand the use of affordable simulation models in engineering design and analysis. In this paper, we introduce a methodology aimed at improving low-fidelity models of turbulence and combustion and obtaining error bounds. Towards this end, we first develop a new machine learning algorithm to construct a stochastic model of the error of low-fidelity models using information from higher-fidelity data sets. Then, by applying this error model to the low-fidelity result, we obtain better approximations of uncertain model outputs and generate confidence intervals on the prediction of simulation outputs. We apply this technique to two representative flow problems. The first application is in flamelet-based simulations to model combustion in a turbulent mixing layer; and the second application is in the prediction of the anisotropy of turbulence in a non-equilibrium boundary layer flow. We demonstrate that our methodology can be used to improve aspects of predictive modeling while offering a route towards obtaining error bounds.},

abstract = {Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is widely used to predict wind conditions for wind energy production purposes. However, as wind power development expands into areas of even more complex terrain and challenging flow conditions, more research is needed to investigate the ability of such models to describe turbulent flow features. In this study, the performance of a hybrid Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS)/Large Eddy Simulation (LES) model in highly complex terrain has been investigated. The model was compared with measurements from a long range pulsed Lidar, which first were validated with sonic anemometer data. The accuracy of the Lidar was considered to be sufficient for validation of flow model turbulence estimates. By reducing the range gate length of the Lidar a slight additional improvement in accuracy was obtained, but the availability of measurements was reduced due to the increased noise floor in the returned signal. The DES model was able to capture the variations of velocity and turbulence along the line-of-sight of the Lidar beam but overestimated the turbulence level in regions of complex flow.},

abstract = {Shape optimization is widely used in practice. The typical problem is to find the optimal shape which minimizes/maximizes a certain cost functional and satisfies some given constraints. Usually shape optimization problems are solved numerically, by some iterative method which also requires some gradient information. There are two approaches to provide such information: the direct approach and the adjoint approach. In this thesis the different approaches, for getting gradient information of the functional, will be presented and then the focus is to compare them. It will be shown that the adjoint approach has a great advantage, but that there also exist examples, where the adjoint technique does not work in the sense we will introduce it. Starting with the explanation of shape optimization, the direct and adjoint approach will be introduced. Then an introduction in shape derivatives is given and some necessary examples for them are shown. On the basis of a two-dimensional magnetostatic field problem, where the mathematical model is derived using Maxwell's equations, and is the varia- tional formulation of a boundary value problem, the process of getting gra- dient information will be shown. Finally, numerical results illustrate the two approaches.},

abstract = {Thermal fluid processes are inherently multi-physics and multi-scale, involving mass-momentum-energy transport phenomena at multiple scales. Thermal fluid simulation (TFS) is based on solving conservative equations, for which – except for “first-principles” direct numerical simulation – closure relations (CRs) are required to provide microscopic interactions or so-called sub-grid-scale physics. In practice, TFS is realized through reduced-order modeling, and its CRs as low-fidelity models can be informed by observations and data from relevant and adequately evaluated experiments and high-fidelity simulations. This paper is focused on data-driven TFS models, specifically on their development using machine learning (ML). Five ML frameworks are introduced including physics-separated ML (PSML or Type I ML), physics-evaluated ML (PEML or Type II ML), physics-integrated ML (PIML or Type III ML), physics-recovered (PRML or Type IV ML), and physics-discovered ML (PDML or Type V ML). The frameworks vary in their performance for different applications depending on the level of knowledge of governing physics, source, type, amount and quality of available data for training. Notably, outlined for the first time in this paper, Type III models present stringent requirements on modeling, substantial computing resources for training, and high potential in extracting value from “big data” in thermal fluid research. The current paper demonstrates and investigates ML frameworks in three examples. First, we utilize the heat diffusion equation with a nonlinear conductivity model formulated by convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and feedforward neural networks (FNNs) to illustrate the applications of Type I, Type II, Type III, and Type V ML. The results indicate a preference for Type II ML under deficient data support. Type III ML can effectively utilize field data, potentially generating more robust predictions than Type I and Type II ML. CNN-based closures exhibit more predictability than FNN-based closures, but CNN-based closures require more training data to obtain accurate predictions. Second, we illustrate how to employ Type I ML and Type II ML frameworks for data-driven turbulence modeling using reference works. Third, we demonstrate Type I ML by building a deep FNN-based slip closure for two-phase flow modeling. The results show that deep FNN-based closures exhibit a bounded error in the prediction domain.},

abstract = {Data-driven methods for improving turbulence modeling in Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) simulations have gained significant interest in the computational fluid dynamics community. Modern machine learning models have opened up a new area of black-box turbulence models allowing for the tuning of RANS simulations to increase their predictive accuracy. While several data-driven turbulence models have been reported, the quantification of the uncertainties introduced has mostly been neglected. Uncertainty quantification for such data-driven models is essential since their predictive capability rapidly declines as they are tested for flow physics that deviate from that in the training data. In this work, we propose a novel data-driven framework that not only improves RANS predictions but also provides probabilistic bounds for fluid quantities such as velocity and pressure. The uncertainties capture include both model form uncertainty as well as epistemic uncertainty induced by the limited training data. An invariant Bayesian deep neural network is used to predict the anisotropic tensor component of the Reynolds stress. This model is trained using Stein's variational gradient decent algorithm. The computed uncertainty on the Reynolds stress is propagated to the quantities of interest by vanilla Monte Carlo simulation. Results are presented for two test cases that differ geometrically from the training flows at several different Reynolds numbers. The prediction enhancement of the data-driven model is discussed as well as the associated probabilistic bounds for flow properties of interest. Ultimately this framework allows for a quantitative measurement of model confidence and uncertainty quantification for flows in which no high-fidelity observations or prior knowledge is available.},

This work builds on previous methods for the identifica-tion of constant coefficient PDEs, expanding the field to include a new class of equations which until now have eluded machine learning based identification methods. We show that group sequentially thresholded ridge regression outperforms group LASSO in identifying the fewest terms in the PDE along with their parametric dependency.

abstract = {Turbulent flow over a series of increasingly high, two-dimensional bumps is studied by well-resolved large-eddy simulation. The mean flow and Reynolds stresses for the lowest bump are in good agreement with experimental data. The flow encounters a favourable pressure gradient over the windward side of the bump, but does not relaminarize, as is evident from near-wall fluctuations. A patch of high turbulent kinetic energy forms in the lee of the bump and extends into the wake. It originates near the surface, before flow separation, and has a significant influence on flow development. The highest bumps create a small separation bubble, whereas flow over the lowest bump does not separate. The log law is absent over the entire bump, evidencing strong disequilibrium. This dataset was created for data-driven modelling. An optimization method is used to extract fields of variables that are used in turbulence closure models. From this, it is shown how these models fail to correctly predict the behaviour of these variables near to the surface. The discrepancies extend further away from the wall in the adverse pressure gradient and recovery regions than in the favourable pressure gradient region.},

abstract = {Figure 1: The obtained results using our regression forest method, capable of simulating millions of particles in realtime. Our promising results suggest the applicability of machine learning techniques to physics-based simulations in time-critical settings, where running time matters more than the physical exactness. Abstract Traditional fluid simulations require large computational resources even for an average sized scene with the main bottleneck being a very small time step size, required to guarantee the stability of the solution. Despite a large progress in parallel computing and effi-cient algorithms for pressure computation in the recent years, real-time fluid simulations have been possible only under very restricted conditions. In this paper we propose a novel machine learning based approach, that formulates physics-based fluid simulation as a regression problem, estimating the acceleration of every particle for each frame. We designed a feature vector, directly modelling individual forces and constraints from the Navier-Stokes equations, giving the method strong generalization properties to reliably pre-dict positions and velocities of particles in a large time step setting on yet unseen test videos. We used a regression forest to approx-imate the behaviour of particles observed in the large training set of simulations obtained using a traditional solver. Our GPU im-plementation led to a speed-up of one to three orders of magnitude compared to the state-of-the-art position-based fluid solver and runs in real-time for systems with up to 2 million particles.},

abstract = {We consider prediction and uncertainty analysis for systems which are approximated using complex mathematical models. Such models, implemented as computer codes, are often generic in the sense that by a suitable choice of some of the model's input parameters the code can be used to predict the behaviour of the system in a variety of specific applications. However, in any specific application the values of necessary parameters may be unknown. In this case, physical observations of the system in the specific context are used to learn about the unknown parameters. The process of fitting the model to the observed data by adjusting the parameters is known as calibration. Calibration is typically effected by ad hoc fitting, and after calibration the model is used, with the fitted input values, to predict the future behaviour of the system. We present a Bayesian calibration technique which improves on this traditional approach in two respects. First, the predictions allow for all sources of uncertainty, including the remaining uncertainty over the fitted parameters. Second, they attempt to correct for any inadequacy of the model which is revealed by a discrepancy between the observed data and the model predictions from even the best-fitting parameter values. The method is illustrated by using data from a nuclear radiation release at Tomsk, and from a more complex simulated nuclear accident exercise.},

abstract = {This is an attempt to clarify and size up the many levels possible for the numerical prediction of a turbulent ¯ow, the target being a complete airplane, turbine, or car. Not all the author's opinions will be accepted, but his hope is to stimulate re¯ection, discussion, and planning. These levels still range from a solution of the steady Reynolds-Averaged Navier±Stokes (RANS) equations to a Direct Numerical Simulation, with Large-Eddy Simulation in between. However recent years have added intermediate strategies, dubbed ``VLES'', ``URANS'' and ``DES''. They are in experimental use and, although more expensive, threaten complex RANS models especially for blu-body and similar ¯ows. Turbulence predictions in aerodynamics face two principal challenges: (I) growth and separation of the boundary layer, and (II) momentum transfer after separation. (I) is simpler, but makes very high accuracy de- mands, and appears to give models of higher complexity little advantage. (II) is now the arena for complex RANS models and the newer strategies, by which time-dependent three-dimensional simulations are the norm even over two-dimensional geometries. In some strategies, grid re{\textregistered}nement is aimed at numerical accuracy; in others it is aimed at richer turbulence physics. In some ap- proaches, the empirical constants play a strong role even when the grid is very {\textregistered}ne; in others, their role vanishes. For several decades, practical methods will necessarily be RANS, possibly unsteady, or RANS/LES hybrids, pure LES being unaordable. Their em- pirical content will remain substantial, and the law of the wall will be particularly resistant. Estimates are oered of the grid res- olution needed for the application of each strategy to full-blown aerodynamic calculations, feeding into rough estimates of its feasibility date, based on computing-power growth.},

abstract = {Bayesian inference provides a consistent method for the extraction of information from physics experiments even in ill-conditioned circumstances. The approach provides a unified rationale for data analysis, which both justifies many of the commonly used analysis procedures and reveals some of the implicit underlying assumptions. This review summarizes the general ideas of the Bayesian probability theory with emphasis on the application to the evaluation of experimental data. As case studies for Bayesian parameter estimation techniques examples ranging from extra-solar planet detection to the deconvolution of the apparatus functions for improving the energy resolution and change point estimation in time series are discussed. Special attention is paid to the numerical techniques suited for Bayesian analysis, with a focus on recent developments of Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms for high-dimensional integration problems. Bayesian model comparison, the quantitative ranking of models for the explanation of a given data set, is illustrated with examples collected from cosmology, mass spectroscopy, and surface physics, covering problems such as background subtraction and automated outlier detection. Additionally the Bayesian inference techniques for the design and optimization of future experiments are introduced. Experiments, instead of being merely passive recording devices, can now be designed to adapt to measured data and to change the measurement strategy on the fly to maximize the information of an experiment. The applied key concepts and necessary numerical tools which provide the means of designing such inference chains and the crucial aspects of data fusion are summarized and some of the expected implications are highlighted.},

abstract = {Data science models, although successful in a number of commercial domains, have had limited applicability in scientific problems involving complex physical phenomena. Theory-guided data science (TGDS) is an emerging paradigm that aims to leverage the wealth of scientific knowledge for improving the effectiveness of data science models in enabling scientific discovery. The overarching vision of TGDS is to introduce scientific consistency as an essential component for learning generalizable models. Further, by producing scientifically interpretable models, TGDS aims to advance our scientific understanding by discovering novel domain insights. Indeed, the paradigm of TGDS has started to gain prominence in a number of scientific disciplines such as turbulence modeling, material discovery, quantum chemistry, bio-medical science, bio-marker discovery, climate science, and hydrology. In this paper, we formally conceptualize the paradigm of TGDS and present a taxonomy of research themes in TGDS. We describe several approaches for integrating domain knowledge in different research themes using illustrative examples from different disciplines. We also highlight some of the promising avenues of novel research for realizing the full potential of theory-guided data science.},

abstract = {Data from experiments and direct simulations of turbulence have historically been used to calibrate simple engineering models such as those based on the Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) equations. In the past few years, with the availability of large and diverse data sets, researchers have begun to explore methods to systematically inform turbulence models with data, with the goal of quantifying and reducing model uncertainties. This review surveys recent developments in bounding uncertainties in RANS models via physical constraints, in adopting statistical inference to characterize model coefficients and estimate discrepancy, and in using machine learning to improve turbulence models. Key principles, achievements, and challenges are discussed. A central perspective advocated in this review is that by exploiting foundational knowledge in turbulence modeling and physical constraints, researchers can use data-driven approaches to yield useful predictive models.},

Furthermore, different kinds of notations are given like the conserved, non-conserved and integral form. After the derivation of all equations, a summary is given and we derive the necessary equations for incompressible turbulent flow fields using the Reynolds time-averaging concept. Here, we will derive the incompressible mass, momentum, Reynolds-Stress, kinetic energy of the turbulence and dissipation equations and show the relations between them. At the end we demonstrate how to derive the equations for compressible flow fields by introducing the Favre averaging concept and applying this to the compressible mass conservation equation. Finally we will analyze the calculation of the shear-rate tensor in OpenFOAM{\textregistered}.

abstract = {We develop an algorithm for model selection which allows for the consideration of a combinatorially large number of candidate models governing a dynamical system. The innovation circumvents a disadvantage of standard model selection which typically limits the number candidate models considered due to the intractability of computing information criteria. Using a recently developed sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics algorithm, the sub-selection of candidate models near the Pareto frontier allows for a tractable computation of AIC (Akaike information criteria) or BIC (Bayes information criteria) scores for the remaining candidate models. The information criteria hierarchically ranks the most informative models, enabling the automatic and principled selection of the model with the strongest support in relation to the time series data. Specifically, we show that AIC scores place each candidate model in the {\{}$\backslash$em strong support{\}}, {\{}$\backslash$em weak support{\}} or {\{}$\backslash$em no support{\}} category. The method correctly identifies several canonical dynamical systems, including an SEIR (susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered) disease model and the Lorenz equations, giving the correct dynamical system as the only candidate model with strong support.},

abstract = {Discover New Methods for Dealing with High-Dimensional Data A sparse statistical model has only a small number of nonzero parameters or weights; therefore, it is much easier to estimate and interpret than a dense model. Statistical Learning with Sparsity: The Lasso and Generalizations presents methods that exploit sparsity to help recover the underlying signal in a set of data. Top experts in this rapidly evolving field, the authors describe the lasso for linear regression and a simple coordinate descent algorithm for its computation. They discuss the application of l1 penalties to generalized linear models and support vector machines, cover generalized penalties such as the elastic net and group lasso, and review numerical methods for optimization. They also present statistical inference methods for fitted (lasso) models, including the bootstrap, Bayesian methods, and recently developed approaches. In addition, the book examines matrix decomposition, sparse multivariate analysis, graphical models, and compressed sensing. It concludes with a survey of theoretical results for the lasso. In this age of big data, the number of features measured on a person or object can be large and might be larger than the number of observations. This book shows how the sparsity assumption allows us to tackle these problems and extract useful and reproducible patterns from big datasets. Data analysts, computer scientists, and theorists will appreciate this thorough and up-to-date treatment of sparse statistical modeling.},

This network is aimed at providing European industries with a knowl- edge base of high quality application challenges and best practice guidelines.

abstract = {We analyze data from direct numerical simulations of homogeneous and isotropic turbulence (at Relambda approx 280) and study the statistics of curvature and torsion of Lagrangian trajectories in order to extract informations on the geometry of small scale coherent structures in turbulent flows. We find that, as previously observed by Braun et al and by Xu et al, the high curvature statistics is dominated by large scale flow reversals where the velocity magnitude assumes very low values. In order to focus on small-scales signatures, we introduce a cutoff on the velocity amplitude and we study the probability distribution of curvature conditioned only on those events when the local velocity is not that small. In this way we are able to select small-scales turbulent features, connected to vortex filaments. We show that the conditioned curvature probability density is well reproduced by a multifractal formalism, following previous calculations made for acceleration. Finally, by studying the joint statistics of curvature and torsion we find further evidences that intense events are dominated by helical type trajectories.},

@article{Lindgren2011,
abstract = {Continuously indexed Gaussian fields (GFs) are the most important ingredient in spatial statistical modelling and geostatistics. The specification through the covariance function gives an intuitive interpretation of the field properties. On the computational side, GFs are hampered with the big n problem, since the cost of factorizing dense matrices is cubic in the dimension. Although computational power today is at an all time high, this fact seems still to be a computational bottleneck in many applications. Along with GFs, there is the class of Gaussian Markov random fields (GMRFs) which are discretely indexed. The Markov property makes the precision matrix involved sparse, which enables the use of numerical algorithms for sparse matrices, that for fields in R{\^{}}2 only use the square root of the time required by general algorithms. The specification of a GMRF is through its full conditional distributions but its marginal properties are not transparent in such a parameterization. We show that, using an approximate stochastic weak solution to (linear) stochastic partial differential equations, we can, for some GFs in the Mat{\'{e}}rn class, provide an explicit link, for any triangulation of R{\^{}}2, between GFs and GMRFs, formulated as a basis function representation. The consequence is that we can take the best from the two worlds and do the modelling by using GFs but do the computations by using GMRFs. Perhaps more importantly, our approach generalizes to other covariance functions generated by SPDEs, including oscillating and non-stationary GFs, as well as GFs on manifolds. We illustrate our approach by analysing global temperature data with a non-stationary model defined on a sphere.},

@article{Launder1974,
abstract = {In the last few years a number of models of turbulent heat and momentum transport have been developed in which the effective transport coefficients are related to local values of certain turbulent correlations; these correlations are computed simultaneously with the mean field variables. Models of this kind achieve significantly greater breadth of applicability than do simpler approaches based on mean-flow quantities alone. One of the more successful of these newer approaches is the energy-dissipation model developed by Jones and Launder (1,2). Its originators applied it to the calculation of numerous boundary layer flows with severe streamwise pressure gradient or surface mass transfer. No applications have been reported, however, of its use to predict swirling flows, an omission that the present note remedies. The flow considered (that generated by a rotating disc in a quiescent atmosphere) produces very high gradients of swirl velocity in the vicinity of the disc which in turn brings to prominence terms in the kinetic energy and dissipation equations that have formerly been absent or of only small importance. This application thus provides a test of the generality of the model for an important class of fluid flows.},

abstract = {Symbolic Regression tries to find a mathematical expression that describes the relationship of a set of explanatory variables to a measured variable. The main objective is to find a model that minimizes the error and, optionally, that also minimizes the expression size. A smaller expression can be seen as an interpretable model considered a reliable decision model. This is often performed with Genetic Programming, which represents their solution as expression trees. The shortcoming of this algorithm lies on this representation that defines a rugged search space and contains expressions of any size and difficulty. These pose as a challenge to find the optimal solution under computational constraints. This paper introduces a new data structure, called Interaction-Transformation (IT), that constrains the search space in order to exclude a region of larger and more complicated expressions. In order to test this data structure, it was also introduced an heuristic called SymTree. The obtained results show evidence that SymTree are capable of obtaining the optimal solution whenever the target function is within the search space of the IT data structure and competitive results when it is not. Overall, the algorithm found a good compromise between accuracy and simplicity for all the generated models.},

Identifying the linear Boussinesq stress-strain hypothesis as a major contribution to erroneous prediction, we consider and contrast two machine learning frameworks for turbulence model development. Gene Expression Programming, an evolutionary algorithm that employs a survival of the fittest analogy, and a Deep Neural Network, based on neurological processing, add non-linear terms to the stress-strain relationship. The results are Explicit Algebraic Stress Model-like closures. High fidelity data from an inline jet in crossflow study is used to regress new closures. These models are then tested on a skewed jet to ascertain their predictive efficacy. For both methodologies, a vast improvement over the linear relationship is observed.},

For complex systems, these reaction networks are not known a priori and cannot be efficiently computed with ab initio methods; therefore, an important goal is to estimate effective reaction networks from observations, such as time series of the main species. Reaction networks estimated with standard machine learning techniques such as least-squares regression may fit the observations but will typically contain spurious reactions. Here we extend the sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) method to vector-valued ansatz functions, each describing a particular reaction process. The resulting sparse tensor regression method “reactive SINDy” is able to estimate a parsimonious reaction network. We illustrate that a gene regulation network can be correctly estimated from observed time series.},

The determination of the limits of predictability is an important issue of both theoretical and practical relevance. In the case of modelling time series, reached a certain level in performance in either modelling or prediction, it is often important to assess whether all the information available in the data has been exploited or whether there are still margins for improvement of the tools being developed. In this paper, an information theoretic approach is proposed to address this issue and quantify the quality of the models and/or predictions. The excellent properties of the proposed indicator have been proved with the help of a systematic series of numerical tests and a concrete example of extreme relevance for nuclear fusion.},

abstract = {The paper presents a detailed analysis of the flow over smoothly contoured constrictions in a plane channel. This configuration represents a generic case of a flow separating from a curved surface with well-defined flow conditions which makes it especially suited as benchmark case for computing separated flows. The hills constrict the channel by about one third of its height and are spaced at a distance of 9 hill heights. This setup follows the investigation of Fr{\"{o}}hlich et al. [Fr{\"{o}}hlich J, Mellen CP, Rodi W, Temmerman L, Leschziner MA. Highly resolved large-eddy simulation of separated flow in a channel with streamwise periodic constrictions. J Fluid Mech 2005;526:19-66] and complements it by numerical and experimental data over a wide range of Reynolds numbers. We present results predicted by direct numerical simulations (DNS) and highly resolved large-eddy simulations (LES) achieved by two completely independent codes. Furthermore, these numerical results are supported by new experimental data from PIV measurements. The configuration in the numerical study uses periodic boundary conditions in streamwise and spanwise direction. In the experimental setup periodicity is achieved by an array of 10 hills in streamwise direction and a large spanwise extent of the channel. The assumption of periodicity in the experiment is checked by the pressure drop between consecutive hill tops and PIV measurements. The focus of this study is twofold: (i) Numerical and experimental data are presented which can be referred to as reference data for this widely used standard test case. Physical peculiarities and new findings of the case under consideration are described and confirmed independently by different codes and experimental data. Mean velocity and pressure distributions, Reynolds stresses, anisotropy-invariant maps, and instantaneous quantities are shown. (ii) Extending previous studies the flow over periodic hills is investigated in the wide range of Reynolds numbers covering 100 ≤ Re ≤ 10, 595. Starting at very low Re the evolution and existence of physical phenomena such as a tiny recirculation region at the hill crest are documented. The limit to steady laminar flow as well as the transition to a fully turbulent flow stage are presented. For 700 ≤ Re ≤ 10, 595 turbulent statistics are analyzed in detail. Carefully, undertaken DNS and LES predictions as well as cross-checking between different numerical and experimental results build the framework for physical investigations on the flow behavior. New interesting features of the flow were found. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {In classical machine learning, regression is treated as a black box process of identifying a suitable function from a hypothesis set without attempting to gain insight into the mechanism connecting inputs and outputs. In the natural sciences, however, finding an interpretable function for a phenomenon is the prime goal as it allows to understand and generalize results. This paper proposes a novel type of function learning network, called equation learner (EQL), that can learn analytical expressions and is able to extrapolate to unseen domains. It is implemented as an end-to-end differentiable feed-forward network and allows for efficient gradient based training. Due to sparsity regularization concise interpretable expressions can be obtained. Often the true underlying source expression is identified.},

abstract = {Deep learning tools have recently gained much attention in applied machine learn- ing. However such tools for regression and classification do not allow us to cap- ture model uncertainty. Bayesian models offer us the ability to reason about model uncertainty, but usually come with a prohibitive computational cost. We show that dropout in multilayer perceptron models (MLPs) can be interpreted as a Bayesian approximation. Results are obtained for modelling uncertainty for dropout MLP models – extracting information that has been thrown away so far, from existing models. This mitigates the problem of representing uncertainty in deep learning without sacrificing computational performance or test accuracy. We perform an exploratory study of the dropout uncertainty properties. Various network architectures and non-linearities are assessed on tasks of extrapolation, interpolation, and classification. We show that model uncertainty is important for classification tasks using MNIST as an example, and use the model's uncertainty in a Bayesian pipeline, with deep reinforcement learning as a concrete example.},

abstract = {When the Navier-Stokes equations are applied into turbulence, closure equations are necessary in addition to an average approach of the associated variables. These equations relate the Reynolds stress tensor with kinematic tensors. The methodology here presented quantifies the dependence of the Reynolds tensor with kinematic tensors such as the rate-of-strain and the non-persistence-of-strain tensors. The methodology is based on tensor decomposition theorems from the Reynolds stress tensor (anisotropic) obtained from LES are extracted parts in phase and parts out of phase with each kinematic tensor. The proposed RANS basis are then compared with the Reynolds tensor which is obtained by a LES in a backward facing step. Local measurers of the accuracy of each model are employed, becoming possible to quantify their adequacy as a function of the position.The tensor basis used in this study are capable of representing more faithfully the Reynolds stress tensor then the methods used by industry today, and require low computational cost.},

The movement of a specimen under investigation relative to a permanent magnet leads to Lorentz forces that are perturbed in the presence of a defect. A minimum norm estimation (MNE) with Elastic Net Regularization (ENR) is compared to MNE with Tikhonov-Phillips-Regularization (TPR) regarding the ability to determine defect properties from force perturbation signals. A cylindrically shaped defect with diameter of 5 mm and height of 2 mm is examined at depths of 2, 4 and 8 mm. Simulated data obtained by the finite element method and measured data are considered. ENR and TPR estimated the defect depth correctly for simulation and measurement data at depths of 2 and 4 mm, while at 8 mm, only ENR estimated the depth correctly. The defect sizes were slightly overestimated for both ENR and TPR. TPR produced additional spurious solutions at the boundary of the reconstruction grid. We conclude that ENR is more suitable than TPR for MNE in Lorentz force evaluation.},

abstract = {This book is intended for self-study or as a companion of lectures delivered to post-graduate students on the subject of the computational prediction of complex turbulent flows. There are several books in the extensive literature on turbulence that deal, in statistical terms, with the phenomenon itself, as well its many manifestations in the context of fluid dynamics. Statistical Turbulence Modelling for Fluid Dynamics — Demystified differs from these and focuses on the physical interpretation of a broad range of mathematical models used to represent the time-averaged effects of turbulence in computational prediction schemes for fluid flow and related transport processes in engineering and the natural environment. It dispenses with complex mathematical manipulations and instead gives physical and phenomenological explanations. This approach allows students to gain a 'feel' for the physical fabric represented by the mathematical structure that describes the effects of turbulence and the models embedded in most of the software currently used in practical fluid-flow predictions, thus counteracting the ill-informed black-box approach to turbulence modelling. This is done by taking readers through the physical arguments underpinning exact concepts, the rationale of approximations of processes that cannot be retained in their exact form, and essential calibration steps to which the resulting models are subjected by reference to theoretically established behaviour of, and experimental data for, key canonical flows.},

The anisotropic modification to the generalised Boussi- nesq hypothesis (1.113) is in the centre of research interest nowadays [45], however, the hybridisation of the generalised version of the Boussinesq hypothesis [4] and the recently developed anisotropic similarity theory of turbulent velocity fluctua- tions [8, 9] is still missing from the literature. In other words, the new hypothesis proposed here is an anisotropic modification to the generalised Boussinesq hypoth- esis (1.113) based on the fully Galilean invariant version of the three-dimensional anisotropic similarity theory of turbulent velocity fluctuations—which is discussed in Chap.4—in conjunction with the mathematical description of the Reynolds stress tensor (1.54). In addition to this, a possible anisotropic hybrid k-$\omega$ SST/Stochastic Turbulence Model (STM) closure approach has also been proposed related to the new hypothesis on the anisotropic Reynolds stress tensor in this chapter.

Gibbs sampling from this posterior is possible using an expanded hierarchy with conjugate normal priors for the regression parameters and independent exponential priors on their variances. A connection with the inverse-Gaussian distribution provides tractable full conditional distributions. The Bayesian Lasso provides interval estimates (Bayesian credible intervals) that can guide variable selection. Moreover, the structure of the hierarchical model provides both Bayesian and likelihood methods for selecting the Lasso parameter.

abstract = {Four classic criteria used to the classification of complex flows are discussed here. These criteria are useful to identify regions of the flow related to shear, elongation or rigid-body motion. These usual criteria, namely Q, $\delta$, $\lambda$2 and $\lambda$cr/$\lambda$ci, use the fluid's rate-of-rotation tensor, which is known to vary with respect to a reference frame. The advantages of using objective (invariant with respect to a general transformation on the reference frame) criteria are discussed in the present work. In this connection, we construct versions of classic criteria replacing standard vorticity, a non-objective quantity, by effective vorticity, a rate-of-rotation tensor with respect to the angular velocity of the eigenvectors of the strain-rate tensor. The classic criteria and their corresponding objective versions are applied to classify two complex flows: the transient ABC flow and the flow through the abrupt 4:1 contraction. It is shown that the objective versions of the criteria provide richer information on the kinematics of the flow.},

abstract = {Machinery prognostics is one of the major tasks in condition based maintenance (CBM), which aims to predict the remaining useful life (RUL) of machinery based on condition information. A machinery prognostic program generally consists of four technical processes, i.e., data acquisition, health indicator (HI) construction, health stage (HS) division, and RUL prediction. Over recent years, a significant amount of research work has been undertaken in each of the four processes. And much literature has made an excellent overview on the last process, i.e., RUL prediction. However, there has not been a systematic review that covers the four technical processes comprehensively. To fill this gap, this paper provides a review on machinery prognostics following its whole program, i.e., from data acquisition to RUL prediction. First, in data acquisition, several prognostic datasets widely used in academic literature are introduced systematically. Then, commonly used HI construction approaches and metrics are discussed. After that, the HS division process is summarized by introducing its major tasks and existing approaches. Afterwards, the advancements of RUL prediction are reviewed including the popular approaches and metrics. Finally, the paper provides discussions on current situation, upcoming challenges as well as possible future trends for researchers in this field.},

In particular we search for estimates grounded in uncertainties in the space of model closure coefficients, for wall-bounded flows at a variety of favorable and adverse pressure gradients. In order to estimate the spread of closure coefficients which reproduces these flows accurately, we perform 13 separate Bayesian calibrations - each at a different pressure gradient - using measured boundary-layer velocity profiles, and a statistical model containing a multiplicative model-inadequacy term in the solution space. The results are 13 joint posterior distributions over coefficients and hyper-parameters. To summarize this information we compute Highest Posterior-Density (HPD) intervals, and subsequently represent the total solution uncertainty with a probability-box (p-box). This p-box represents both parameter variability across flows, and epistemic uncertainty within each calibration. A prediction of a new boundary-layer flow is made with uncertainty bars generated from this uncertainty information, and the resulting error estimate is shown to be consistent with measurement data. ?? 2013.},

This dimension reduction enables otherwise infeasible uncertainty quantification, considering the simulation cost of roughly 9500 CPU-hours per run. For two values of the fuel injection rate, we use a total of 68 simulations to (i) identify the parameters that contribute the most to the variation in the output quantity of interest, (ii) estimate upper and lower bounds on the quantity of interest, (iii) classify sets of operating conditions as safe or unsafe corresponding to a threshold on the output quantity of interest, and (iv) estimate a cumulative distribution function for the quantity of interest.},

abstract = {Empirical Bayes is a versatile approach to `learn from a lot' in two ways: first, from a large number of variables and second, from a potentially large amount of prior information, e.g. stored in public repositories. We review applications of a variety of empirical Bayes methods to a broad spectrum of prediction methods including penalized regression, random forest, linear discriminant analysis, and Bayesian models with sparse or dense priors. We discuss `formal' empirical Bayes methods which maximize the marginal likelihood, but also more informal approaches based on other data summaries. We contrast empirical Bayes to cross-validation and full Bayes, and discuss hybrid approaches. To study the relation between the quality of an empirical Bayes estimator and {\$}p{\$}, the number of variables, we derive the expected mean squared error of a simple empirical Bayes estimator in a linear model setting. We argue that empirical Bayes is particularly useful when the prior contains multiple parameters, modeling a priori information on variables, termed `co-data'. In particular, we present two novel examples that allow for co-data. First, a Bayesian spike-and-slab setting that facilitates inclusion of multiple co-data sources and types; second, a hybrid empirical Bayes-full Bayes ridge regression approach for estimation of the posterior predictive interval.},

abstract = {Different techniques for deriving explicit algebraic Reynolds stress models (EARSMs) using incomplete sets of basis tensors are discussed. The first is the Galerkin method which has been used by several authors. The second alternative technique, proposed here, is based on the least-squares method. The idea behind the latter method is to minimize the error induced in the implicit relation, i.e., the algebraic Reynolds stress model (ARSM) equation, due to the use of incomplete sets of basis tensors. It is argued that since the system matrix of the ARSM equation is not symmetric and positive definite, the Galerkin method does not give EARSMs that are optimal in the strict classical sense. The possible singular behavior depending on the choice of the basis tensors has also been investigated. It is demonstrated that many of the EARSMs based on incomplete tensor bases, expressed in general three-dimensional mean flows, have singularity problems in some flows, such as general two-dimensional (2D) mean flows or more specifically, strain- and/or rotation-free 2D mean flows. The different EARSMs emanating from the two derivation methods are investigated by computing fully developed rotating pipe flow. The results indicate that the EARSMs derived with the least-squares method capture the behavior of the complete EARSMs significantly better than those derived with the Galerkin method. Furthermore, by using mean flow data from the complete EARSMs to evaluate the square error of the incomplete EARSMs it is demonstrated that the least-squares based EARSMs have square errors significantly smaller than the Galerkin EARSMs, very close to minimum.

abstract = {Data-driven methods for improving turbulence modeling in Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) simulations have gained significant interest in the computational fluid dynamics community. Modern machine learning models have opened up a new area of black-box turbulence models allowing for the tuning of RANS simulations to increase their predictive accuracy. While several data-driven turbulence models have been reported, the quantification of the uncertainties introduced has mostly been neglected. Uncertainty quantification for such data-driven models is essential since their predictive capability rapidly declines as they are tested for flow physics that deviate from that in the training data. In this work, we propose a novel data-driven framework that not only improves RANS predictions but also provides probabilistic bounds for fluid quantities such as velocity and pressure. The uncertainties capture include both model form uncertainty as well as epistemic uncertainty induced by the limited training data. An invariant Bayesian deep neural network is used to predict the anisotropic tensor component of the Reynolds stress. This model is trained using Stein's variational gradient decent algorithm. The computed uncertainty on the Reynolds stress is propagated to the quantities of interest by vanilla Monte Carlo simulation. Results are presented for two test cases that differ geometrically from the training flows at several different Reynolds numbers. The prediction enhancement of the data-driven model is discussed as well as the associated probabilistic bounds for flow properties of interest. Ultimately this framework allows for a quantitative measurement of model confidence and uncertainty quantification for flows in which no high-fidelity observations or prior knowledge is available.},

@article{Ehrhard2000,
abstract = {Numerical modelling of turbulence plays a crucial role in providing accurate wind fields, which are necessary to predict transport and dispersion of pollutants in the vicinity of buildings reliably. Although the standard k-$\epsilon$ has some well-known deficiencies and more elaborate turbulence models have been developed it is still by far the most widely applied in atmospheric flow and dispersion models. The large CPU time requirement of direct numerical simulation (DNS) and large eddy simulation (LES) still prohibits their application to wind engineering problems of practical interest. Many linear two-equation turbulence models have been proposed in recent years to overcome the deficiencies of the standard k-$\epsilon$ turbulence model. However, comparison shows that none achieves much greater accuracy in all regions of typical wind engineering flow fields. In this paper, a new nonlinear turbulence model is proposed which leads to improved results compared to a conventional eddy-viscosity scheme. The flows considered for the validation of the new model range from simple shear and boundary layer flows, to flows around arrays of cubic obstacles. The accuracy of the proposed turbulence model is assessed by comparing the numerical results with wind-tunnel measurements. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The new developments include a new near-wall treatment ensuring realizability for the individual stress components, a formulation for compressible flows, and a suggestion for a possible approximation of diffusion terms in the anisotropy transport equation. Recent developments in this area are assessed and collected into a model for both incompressible and compressible three-dimensional wall-bounded turbulent flows. This model represents a solution of the implicit ARSM equations, where the production to dissipation ratio is obtained as a solution to a nonlinear algebraic relation. Three-dimensionality is fully accounted for in the mean flow description of the stress anisotropy. The resulting EARSM has been found to be well suited to integration to the wall and all individual Reynolds stresses can be well predicted by introducing wall damping functions derived from the van Driest damping function. The platform for the model consists of the transport equations for the kinetic energy and an auxiliary quantity. The proposed model can be used with any such platform, and examples are shown for two different choices of the auxiliary quantity.},

The data show that this recirculation bubble is far from being laminar except in the very near wall layer. A novel "differential a priori" procedure was used, in which the full transport equation for one isolated component of the Reynolds stress tensor was solved using DNS data as input. Conclusions are then different from what would have been deduced by comparing a full simulation to a DNS. In particular, the ∈-equation, usually blamed for faults in model predictions, has been found to give excellent results in this case. In fact, the main problem comes from the uv̄-equation which predicts a too high turbulent force. A modification, by including the gradients of mean flow in the transport model, has then been attempted and has cured 50 percent of the backflow discrepancy.},

abstract = {When the Navier-Stokes equations are applied into turbulence, closure equations are necessary in addition to an average approach of the associated variables. These equations relate the Reynolds stress tensor with kinematic tensors. The methodology here presented quantifies the dependence of the Reynolds tensor with kinematic tensors such as the rate-of-strain and the non-persistence-of-strain tensors. The methodology is based on tensor decomposition theorems from the Reynolds stress tensor (anisotropic) obtained from LES are extracted parts in phase and parts out of phase with each kinematic tensor. The proposed RANS basis are then compared with the Reynolds tensor which is obtained by a LES in a backward facing step. Local measurers of the accuracy of each model are employed, becoming possible to quantify their adequacy as a function of the position.The tensor basis used in this study are capable of representing more faithfully the Reynolds stress tensor then the methods used by industry today, and require low computational cost.},

@article{Brunton2019a,
abstract = {The field of fluid mechanics is rapidly advancing, driven by unprecedented volumes of data from experiments, field measurements, and large-scale simulations at multiple spatiotemporal scales. Machine learning presents us with a wealth of techniques to extract information from data that can be translated into knowledge about the underlying fluid mechanics. Moreover, machine learning algorithms can augment domain knowledge and automate tasks related to flow control and optimization. This article presents an overview of past history, current developments, and emerging opportunities of machine learning for fluid mechanics. We outline fundamental machine learning methodologies and discuss their uses for understanding, modeling, optimizing, and controlling fluid flows. The strengths and limitations of these methods are addressed from the perspective of scientific inquiry that links data with modeling, experiments, and simulations. Machine learning provides a powerful information processing framework that can augment, and possibly even transform, current lines of fluid mechanics research and industrial applications.},
